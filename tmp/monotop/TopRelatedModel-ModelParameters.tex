 Which parameters impact the kinematics (this is the only relevant aspect form the experimental point of view)? 
 Some studies would be nice to put in this documents about:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item mediator mass
  \item mediator width \com{$\to$ no effect (or parametrizable effects, plots are ready and need to be included)}
  \item \textbf{which parameters} impact our experimental sensitivity? Which plane should be scanned?
 \end{itemize}

 What are the relevant numerical range to explore? First guess would be to follow the mono-top analysis.
