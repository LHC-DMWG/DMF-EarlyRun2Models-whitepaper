\section{Motivations and models description}
\label{sec:MotivModelDescription}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this note, we want to describe the phenomenology of dark matter models involving a strong coupling to the top quark.
These models can be classified according to their flavour structure. When they are close the Standard Model flavour scheme, 
they essentially lead to $\ttbar + \met$ final state and are described in a separated document. Since we don't know the flavour structure
of the dark matter, it's interesting to relax this constraint leading to other experimental signatures: monotop final state 
and a prompt production of two top quarks having the same electric charge \textcolor{red}{Introduction do be modified since this is note quite correct}. 
These two final states have are forbiden at the leading order in the Standard Model and become thus a good area to search for any new physics, 
and in particular dark matter.

\subsection{Model structure}

The full details of the various models are described in \com{[ref]} but the basics ingredients are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the theory is effective but respects the $\SUtwoUone$ symmetry,
 \item the dark matter sector is coupled to SM fields via a mediator field which couple to the top quark,
 \item the top quark is \textit{singly} produced in association with a new particle $\Xnew$ (dark matter or mediator),
%  \item couplings should allow a visible $t\Xnew$ production rate in proton-proton collisions.
\end{enumerate}

There are 2 classes of model based on the monotop production mode: resonant and non-resonant production.

\com{Add a feynman diagram fo each type of process - those from the monotop paper}

\subsubsection{Resonant production}

In this case, the mediator is a charged scalar $\phi$ decaying into a top quark and a spin-$1/2$ invisible particle, $\chi$ 
($\Xnew$ is then the dark matter candidate $\chi$). The dynamics of the new sector is then described by the following lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:lagrangianResonant}
 \Lagr_{\mathrm{int}} \; = \; g^{ij}_{\phi ud} \: \bar{u}_i d_{j} \: \phi^{\pm} \; + \; g^{k}_{\phi u\chi} \: \bar{u}_{k} \chi
\end{equation}
where the first term leads to the production of the mediator and the last term allows its decay into a $up$ quark 
and a non interacting fermion (in particular to the top quark when $g^{k}_{\phi u\chi}$ is sizable mainly for $k=3$).
This model is then described by the masses of the mediator $m_{\phi}$ and the invisible fermion $m_{\chi}$, and the coupling matrices 
($g^{ij}_{\phi ud}$, $g^{k}_{\phi u\chi}$).

\com{Edition comments:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Restore the more complete chiral structure of the lagrangian
 \item Should we harmonize the notations with the monotop paper?
\end{itemize}
}

\subsubsection{Non resonant production}

For the non-resonant production, the top quark is produced in association with the mediator 
($\Xnew$ is then the mediator and not the dark matter candidate). They are two possibilites 
depending on the nature of the mediator.

First, the mediator can be a scalar field interacting with the SM field and the dark matter candidate as described in this lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:lagrangianNonResonantScalar}
 \Lagr_{\mathrm{int}} \; = \; g^{ij}_{\phi u} \: \bar{u}_{i} u_{j} \phi \; + \;  g_{\phi\chi} \: \bar{\chi}\chi \: \phi
\end{equation}
where the first term describe the interaction between the mediator and the $up$ quarks while the second term leads to the decay the mediator 
into invisible fermions. In this model, there is necessarily a mixing between $\phi$ and  the Higgs boson field. Additional parameters 
are then requiered to describe this new sector. Indeed, on top of the mediator mass and couplings, the mixing matix of the two scalar field
is needed in order to make predictions. For the sake of simplicity, we do not consider this case was the parameters 
space would be too large.

Another possibility is to consider a vectorial field as mediator with the following dymanics:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:lagrangianNonResonantVector}
 \Lagr_{\mathrm{int}} \; = \; g^{ij}_{Vu} \: \bar{u}_i \gam^{\mu} u_{j} \: V_{\mu} \; + \; g_{V\chi} \: \bar{\chi}\gam^{\mu} \chi \: V_{\mu}
\end{equation}
where the first term describe the interaction between the mediator and the $up$ quarks while the second term leads to the decay the mediator 
into invisible fermions. \com{Why it cannot mix with $\Zboson$ in case of vectorial mediator ?} The new sector can be defined 
with the couplings ($g^{ij}_{Vu}$, $g_{V\chi}$) and the masses $m_V$ and $m_{\chi}$. This model can be
probed by two experimental signatures depending on the exact scenario: monotop and same-sign top quark production. 

\com{To do:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Restore the more complete chiral structure of the lagrangian
 \item Harmonize the notations with the monotop paper
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Simplifications}
 
The lagrangians~\eqref{eq:lagrangianResonant} and~\eqref{eq:lagrangianNonResonantVector} contains too many degrees of freedom, 
which makes the LHC phenomenology difficult to predict. In addition, only a certain region of the parameter space can actually be probed with a monotop final state.
For these reasons, further simplifications are performed in particular in term of flavour and chiral structure of the model. 
These simplications leads to some limitations in the way ATLAS and CMS can constrain the model parameter space and these limiations are also qualitativly discussed below.

\subsubsection{Flavour structure}

The flavour structure is simplifed in order to have a reasonnable signal production rate in proton-proton collisions.
In case of a scalar mediator, it has to be sufficiently produced so it has to couple with proton content, namely lightest quark which 
are allowed in equation~\eqref{eq:lagrangianResonant}. The monotop final state is sensitive to scenario where $\phi$ strongly couples to $t\chi$.
\com{Correct and/or complete with the monotop paper}. In term of parameter space, it means that the monotop final state is not sensitive
to some parameters like coupling between the mediator and heavy quarks or scenario in which $\BR{\phi}{t\chi} \ll 100 \%$. For the latest, 
there is a way to recover the sensitivity looking at $u_i d_j \to \phi \to u_i d_j$. Since $S$ must be produced, it has to coupled to quarks 
and must decay in in the same final state. Experimentally, this would correspond to a di-jet resonance search.

The same kind of simplification is performed for the non-resonant production. The equation~\eqref{eq:lagrangianNonResonantVector} is simplified in the parameter
space where a monotop final state can be sufficiently produced to be detected at the LHC. The mediator $V$ must be produced from light quark initial state, 
in a association with a top quark: this signature can mainly probe a high coupling $g^{13}_{Vu}\equiv g_{Vtu}$. In addition, the mediatior must decay into invisible particles
to lead to the searched monotop final state. As a consequence, the sensivity for other flavour coupling might be low as well 
as for scenario where $\BR{V}{\chi\chi}\ll 100\%$. To cope with the second limitation, a same-sign top quark final state $gu \to tV(\to t\bar{u})$ is proposed to cover the cases where $V$ would decay
into visible particules. This is case is more likely as the $tV$ production rate increases, and becomes then a key point to constraint this model in a consistent way.

\com{Question to be answered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item How well these flavour assumptions are allowed by the other HEP data (proton decay life time, flavour physics, etc ...) ?
 \item MFV criteria ?
\end{itemize}
}

\subsubsection{Chiral structure}

\com{Needed to properly describe this model simplification:  complete chiral structure in equation~\eqref{eq:lagrangianResonant} and~\eqref{eq:lagrangianNonResonantVector}}
 
The main point here is to consider only right handed quark components in order to not simplify the phenomenology. In fact, the representation of the left-handed 
components under the $\SUtwo$ symmetry impose a couplings to $down$-type quarks, since the effective theory is invariant under $\SUtwoUone$ gauge symmetry). Having a coupling between
the mediator and $down$-type quarks fairly complicates the collider phenomenology in term of decay mode. Typically, including the left-handed components of quarks in the lagrangian~\eqref{eq:lagrangianNonResonantVector} describing the $Vtu$ vertex would lead to  \com{Choose good notation of the couplings}
\begin{equation}
 \Lagr_{Vtu} \; = \; g_{R} \: \bar{t}_{R}\gam^{\mu}u_R \: V_{\mu} \; + \; g_{L} \left(   \bar{t}_{L}\gam^{\mu}u_L \: + \:  \bar{b}_{L}\gam^{\mu}d_L \right) \: V_{\mu}
\end{equation}
where the second term ensure the invariance under $\SUtwo$ rotations, and lead to an additional decay mode $V \to b\bar{d} + \bar{b}d$ (on top of $V \to t\bar{u} + \bar{t}u$ and $V \to \chi\chi$). 
 
\subsubsection{ATLAS and CMS simplifications}
 
 \com{Just check what are the simplifications done in CMS monotop models}
 
 
\section{Collider signatures}
\label{sec:ColliderSignature}
 
 As explained in the section~\ref{sec:MotivModelDescription}, there are two types of models that can be constrainted the following signatures at the LHC:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $t+\met$ final state (resonant and non-resonant production)
  \item $tt$ final state (non-resonant production)
 \end{enumerate}
 These two productions are highly suppressed in the SM and makes these channels good candidates to search for new physics. In the current section, details about the global search strategy are given in each cases and the interplay between the two final state is described. Finally, some considerations on pratical aspects are discussed, such as paramters scan or PDF and showering modeling for the signal generation.
 
 \subsection{Search strategy}
 
 \subsubsection{$t+\met$ final state}
 
 The search performed during the LHC Run 1~\com{[ref]} describes the search strategy in this channel. \com{We can add some basics ideas about typical signature (large $\met$), which channel is more sensitive (I guess $\ell+b+\met$), and what are the main backgrounds. Are they some improvements or new ideas for the Run 2?}
 
 \subsubsection{$tt$ final state}
 
 \com{
 Describe what is the experimental signature which is relevant: $\ssll+X$ with a $b-$jet an a hard ligh jet. What are the typical backgrounds? What kind of cross-section are reachable in $\ssll$ final state [ref Run 1 analysis]? This final state is already looked at but not interpreted in term this model. Also, there is nice feature of having a very hard leading jet (coming from $V\to tu$), which can be exploited.
 }
 
 \subsubsection{Combination for the non-resonant production}
 
 
 
 
 \subsection{Relevant model parameters}

 Which parameters impact the kinematics (this is the only relevant aspect form the experimental point of view)? 
 Some studies would be nice to put in this documents about:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item mediator mass
  \item mediator width
  \item \textbf{which parameters} impact our experimental sensitivity? Which plane should be scanned?
 \end{itemize}

 What are the relevant numerical range to explore? First guess would be to follow the mono-top analysis.
 
 \subsection{Partical implementation}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item generator choice
  \item showering/PDF central values \& systemtics
 \end{itemize}
