\sout{As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:scalar}, the MFV assumption entails a spin-$0$ mediator that couples most strongly to top quarks on account of Yukawa couplings}.
\hto{As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:scalar}, the MFV assumption leads for spin-$0$ mediators to quark mass dependent Yukawa couplings and therefore dominant couplings to top quarks.}

\sout{ For establishing benchmarks, DM tt models with a scalar phi or a pseudoscalar a are the most compelling.}
\hto{[BP: Physics first:] Therefore DM+}$t\bar{t}$\hto{searches are strongly physically motivated and it is important to establish benchmarks for collider searches following the assumptions described in Sec.~\ref{sec:scalar}, in particular a Dirac fermion DM particle, universal couplings and minimum width.}
\sout{The simplifications mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:scalar} are followed; namely, coupling of the mediator to SM Higgs are not considered and universal SM-mediator couplings are assumed. Another simplification is to assume minimal width, so that }$\Gamma_{\phi,a}$\sout{is considered a dependent variable in the models. The DM particle is taken to be a Dirac fermion.}

\hto{Benchmark points have been selected to ensure that} \sout{The primary consideration for selecting the set of benchmark points is to ensure} the kinematic features of the parameter space are sufficiently represented. Detailed studies were performed to identify points in the $m_{\chi}$, $m_{\phi,a}$, $g_{\chi}$, $g_{v}$ (and $\Gamma_{\phi,a}$), parameter space that differ significantly from each other in terms of expected detector acceptance. Because missing \hto transverse momentum \sout{energy} is the key observable for searches, the mediator $p_{T}$ spectra is taken to represent the \hto{main} kinematics of a model. Another consideration in determining the set of benchmarks is to \sout{restrict to cases  where we have sensitivity} \hto{to focus on phase space where we expected to gain sensitivity during the LHC run in 2015}. Based on the \sout{estimated} \hto{projected} integrated luminosity of $30\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$ expected \hto{for} 2015, we disregard models \hto{with} cross section times branching ratio smaller than $0.1\,{\rm fb}$.

\subsection{Parameter scan}
The kinematics \sout{show the strongest dependence} \hto{is most dependent} on the masses $m_{\chi}$ and $m_{\phi,a}$. \hto{Figure~\ref{fig:scanPhi} and~\ref{fig:scanPhiPseudo} show typical depenencies
for for scalar, pseudoscalar couplings respectively.}
\sout{Examples of the dependence on mediator mass are given in Figs.\sout{ures}~\ref{fig:scanPhi} and~\ref{fig:scanPhiPseudo} for the scalar and pseudoscalar respectively}.\sout{ There are} \hto{The} two relevant thresholds \hto{are}: $m_{\phi,a} = 2m_{\chi}$ and $m_{\phi,a} = 2m_t$. When the mediator \hto{mass exceeds} both \sout{these} thresholds \hto{then} the $p_{T}$ spectra broadens with larger $m_{\phi,a}$ and the kinematics for $\phi$ and $a$ are \sout{quite similar} \sout{comparable}. The mediator $p_{T}$ spectra changes significantly when crossing these thresholds. \hto{For instance} \hto{In particular} kinematics are different for an on-shell mediator compared to an off-shell mediator ($m_{\phi,a}<2m_{\chi}$). Furthermore, the scalar \hto{case} differs from the pseudoscalar \hto{one} when $m_{\phi}<2m_t$. Therefore, it is important to \sout{have benchmark points } cover both sides of these thresholds \hto{with sufficient benchmark points}.

Typically, \sout{the kinematics show little dependence on the width -- or equivalently on the couplings} \hto{typically only weak dependencies on width or equivalently couplings are observed}  (see Fig.\sout{ure}~\ref{fig:widthsmallscan}), except \sout{at} \hto{for} large mediator masses of $\sim 1.5\,{\rm TeV}$ or \hto{for} very small couplings of $\sim 10^{-2}$. These regimes where width effects are significant have \sout{signal strengths} \hto{production cross section} that are too \sout{weak} \hto{small} to be relevant for $30\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$ and are not considered here. However, with the full dataset of Run-2, such models may be within reach. The generally weak dependence on typical width values can be understood as the parton distribution function \sout{being} \hto{are} the dominant effect on mediator production. In other words, for couplings $\sim O(1)$ the width is \sout{broad} \hto{large} enough that the $p_T$ of the mediator is determined mainly by the PDF.

Another case where the width can impact the kinematics is when $m_{\phi,a}$ is slightly larger than $2m_\chi$. Here, the width determines the relative contribution between on-shell and off-shell production. An example is given in Fig.\sout{ure}~\ref{fig:widthlargescan}. \htg{In our reccomendations we propose to use for semplicity the minimal width, as this is represents the most conservative choice to interpret the LHC results}

Given that the kinematics are similar for all couplings $\sim O(1)$, we \sout{make a simplification to generate benchmark models with} \hto{we generate only samples with} $g_{\chi} = g_{v} = 1$. It follows that the model should be a good approximation for non-unity couplings and $g_{\chi} \neq g_{v}$ provided that the sample is normalized to the appropriate cross section times branching ratio. While a simple scaling function can be found that works for a limited range of coupling values (see Fig.\sout{ure}~\ref{fig:xsec_scaling} for example), we \sout{opt} \hto{chose} to provide instead a table of cross section times branching ratio values over a large range of couplings to support interpretation of search results (see Sec.tion~\ref{subsec:xsectable}). The table \hto{covers} lists couplings from $g=0.1$ to $g=3.5$, where the upper limit is chosen to \sout{lie near but below the} \hto{close to the} perturbative limit.

\subsection{Benchmarks}
The benchmark points are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ttdm_benchmarks}. In addition to the considerations discussed in the preceding subsections, very light DM fermions are included ($m_{\chi}=1, 10\,{\rm GeV}$) as these are beyond the reach of current direct detection experiments, and a few points are chosen to overlap with monojet benchmarks to facilitate comparison with searches in different final states.
