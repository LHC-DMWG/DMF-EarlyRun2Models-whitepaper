As pointed out in Ref.~\cite{Bell:2015sza}, the mono-$W$ signature can probe the iso-spin violating interactions of dark matter with quarks. The relevant operator after the electroweak symmetry breaking is 
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}\overline{\chiDM} \gamma_\mu \chiDM \left( \overline{u}_L \gamma^\mu u_L + \xi \bar{d}_L \gamma^\mu d_L \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
Here, we only keep the left-handed quarks because the right-handed quarks do not radiate a $W$-gauge boson from the weak interaction. As the LHC constrains the cutoff to higher values, it is also important to know the corresponding operators before the electroweak symmetry. At the dimension-six level, the following operator
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{c_6}{\Lambda^2}\overline{\chiDM} \gamma_\mu \chiDM \,\overline{Q}_L \gamma^\mu Q_L 
\end{equation}
%
conserves iso-spin and provides us $\xi=1$~\cite{Bell:2015sza}. At the dimension-eight level, new operators appear to induce iso-spin violation and can be
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{c^d_8}{\Lambda^4}\overline{\chiDM} \gamma_\mu \chiDM \,(H\overline{Q}_L) \gamma^\mu (Q_L H^\dagger) 
+ \frac{c^u_8}{\Lambda^4}\overline{\chiDM} \gamma_\mu \chiDM \,(\tilde{H}\overline{Q}_L) \gamma^\mu (Q_L \tilde{H}^\dagger)  \,.
\end{equation}
% 
After inputting the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, we have 
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{c_6 \,+\, c_8^d\,v_{\rm EW}^2/2\Lambda^2}{c_6 \,+\, c_8^u \,v_{\rm EW}^2/2\Lambda^2} \,.
\end{equation}
% 
For a nonzero $c_6$ and $v_{\rm EW} \ll \Lambda$, the iso-spin violation effects are suppressed. On the other hand, the values of $c_6$, $c^d_8$ and $c^u_8$ depend on the UV-models. 

There is one possible UV-model to obtain a zero value for $c_6$ and non-zero values for $c^d_8$ and $c^u_8$. One can have the dark matter and the SM Higgs field charged under a new $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry. There is a small mass mixing between SM $Z$-boson and the new \Zprime with a mixing angle of ${\cal O}(v_{\rm EW}^2/M^2_{\Zprime})$. After integrating out \Zprime, one has different effective dark matter couplings to $u_L$ and $d_L$ fields, which are proportional to their couplings to the $Z$ boson. For this model, we have $c_6=0$ and 
 %
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \sin^2{\theta_W} }{ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} \sin^2{\theta_W}} \approx  -2.7 
\end{equation}
%
and order of unity. 

\subsection{Simplified model corresponding to dimension-5 EFT operator}

As an example of a simplified model corresponding to the dimension-5 EFT operator 
described in Section~\ref{sec:EFT_models_with_direct_DM_boson_couplings}, 
we consider a Higgs portal with a scalar mediator. Models of this kind
are among the most concise versions of simplified models that produce 
couplings of Dark Matter to pairs of gauge-bosons.  Scalar fields may couple directly to pairs of electroweak gauge bosons, 
but must carry part of the electroweak vacuum expectation value.  One may thus consider a simple model where Dark Matter couples to a a scalar 
singlet mediator, which mixes with the fields in the Higgs sector.
\begin{equation}
L\subset \frac{1}{2} m_s S^2 + \lambda S^2|H|^2 +\lambda^{'} S |H|^2 + y S \chiDM \overline{\chiDM}
\end{equation}
Where H is a field in the Higgs sector that contains part of the electroweak vacuum expectation value, 
S is a heavy scalar singlet and $\chiDM$ is a Dark Matter field. 
There is then an \schannel diagram where DM pairs couple to the singlet field S, 
which then mixes with a Higgs-sector field, and couples to W and Z bosons. 
This diagram contains 2 insertions of EW symmetry breaking fields, 
corresponding in form to the effective dimension-5 operator in Section~\ref{sub:EW_EFT_Dim5}.

\subsection{Inert two-Higgs Doublet Model (IDM)}\label{sec:i2HDM}

For most of the simplified models included in this report, the mass of
the mediator and couplings/width are non-trivial parameters of the
model. In these scenarios, we remain agnostic about the theory behind
the dark matter sector and try to parameterize it in simple terms.

We have not addressed how to extend the simplified models to realistic
and viable models which are consistent with the symmetries of the
Standard Model. Simplified models often violate gauge invariance which
is a crucial principle for building a consistent BSM model which
incorporates SM together with new physics. For example, with a new
heavy gauge vector boson mediating DM interactions, one needs not just
the dark matter and its mediator, but also a mechanism which provides
mass to this mediator in a gauge invariant way.

Considering both the simplified model and other elements necessary for a consistent theory is a next logical step. The authors of \cite{Belyaev:2015tap} term these Minimal
Consistent Dark Matter (MCDM) models. MCDM models are at the same time still toy models that can be 
easily incorporated into a bigger BSM model and explored via
complementary constraints from collider and direct/indirect DM search
experiments as well as relic density constraints. 

%We discuss this model here both on its own merits and as an example of the flexibility of the simplified model approach.

%The idea of an Inert two-Higgs Doublet Model (IDM) was introduced more than 30 years ago in \cite{IDMfirst}. The IDM was first proposed as a dark matter model in \cite{IDMnaturalness} and its DM phenomenology was further studied in \cite{IDMarchetype,
%ScalarMultiplet,IDMnewviable,IDMgammalines,}. 


The idea of an inert Two-Higgs Doublet Model (IDM) was introduced
more than 30 years ago in Ref~\cite{Deshpande:1977rw}. The IDM was
first proposed as a Dark Matter model in Ref.~\cite{IDMnaturalness} and its
phenomenology further studied in Refs.~\cite{LopezHonorez:2006gr,ScalarMultiplet,IDMnewviable,IDMgammalines,Dolle:2009fn,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-007,IDMnu1,IDMnu2,IDMpos,IDMVIB,Goudelis:2013uca,Belyaev:2015tap}. It is an extension of the SM with a second scalar 
doublet $\phi_2$ with no direct coupling to fermions.  This doublet has a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry, 
under which $\phi_2$ is odd and all the other fields are even. 
The Lagrangian of the odd sector is,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(D_{\mu}\phi_2)^2 -V(\phi_1,\phi_2)
\end{equation}
with the  potential $V$  containing mass terms and $\phi_1 - \phi_2$
interactions:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    V &=& -m_1^2 (\phi_1^{\dagger}\phi_1) - m_2^2 (\phi_2^{\dagger}\phi_2) + \lambda_1 (\phi_1^{\dagger}\phi_1)^2 + \lambda_2 (\phi_2^{\dagger}\phi_2)^2    \nonumber  \\
      &+&  \lambda_3(\phi_2^{\dagger}\phi_2)(\phi_1^{\dagger}\phi_1)  + \lambda_4(\phi_2^{\dagger}\phi_1)(\phi_1^{\dagger}\phi_2) + 
          \frac{\lambda_5}{2}\left[(\phi_1^{\dagger}\phi_2)^2 + (\phi_2^{\dagger}\phi_1)^2 \right],
  \end{eqnarray}

where $\phi_1$ and  $\phi_2$ are SM and inert Higgs doublets respectively carrying the same hypercharge. These doublets can be parameterized as
\begin{equation}
  \phi_1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\
    v+H 
  \end{pmatrix}
  \qquad
  \phi_2= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \sqrt{2}{h^+} \\
    h_1 + ih_2
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In addition to the SM, the IDM introduces four more degrees of freedom coming from the inert doublet in the form of a $Z_2$-odd charged scalar $h^\pm$ and two neutral $Z_2$-odd scalars $h_1$ and $h_2$. The lightest neutral scalar, $h_1$ is identified as the dark matter candidate. Aspects of the IDM collider phenomenology have been studied in \cite{Burgess:2000yq, Andreas:2008xy, Arhrib:2013ela, Belyaev:2015tap,IDMnaturalness,IDMLEPII,IDMLHChinvfirst,IDMdileptons1,IDMtrileptons,IDMmultileptons,IDMhgaga1,IDMhgaga2,IDMposthiggs,IDMdileptonsII}. Its LHC signatures include dileptons \cite{IDMdileptons1,IDMdileptonsII}, trileptons \cite{IDMtrileptons} and multileptons \cite{IDMmultileptons} along with missing transverse energy, modifications of the Higgs branching ratios \cite{IDMhgaga1,IDMhgaga2,Goudelis:2013uca}, as well as $\slashed{E}_T + \rm{jet}$, Z, and Higgs and $\slashed{E}_T + \rm{VBF}$ signals (see Figs.~\ref{fig:fdmonojet1}--\ref{fig:fdvbf}).

Based on the various LHC search channels, DM phenomenology issues and theoretical considerations, numerous works have proposed benchmark scenarios for the IDM, see e.g. \cite{IDMmultileptons,Goudelis:2013uca} while a FeynRules implementation (including MadGraph, CalcHEP and micrOMEGAs model files) was provided in \cite{IDMmultileptons}. An updated analysis of the parameter space has recently been performed in Ref.~\cite{Belyaev:2015tap}. 

The authors suggested to study mono-X  signatures that are relevant to model-independent collider DM searches,
and evaluated their rates presented below. They have implemented and cross-checked the IDM model into CalcHEP and micrOMEGAs,
with an implementation publicly available on the  ~\href{http://hepmdb.soton.ac.uk/hepmdb:0615.0189}{HEPMDB database}, including loop-induced $HHG$ and $\gamma\gamma H$ models. They propose an additional set of benchmark points, mostly inspired by mono-$X$ and VBF searches (Table.~\ref{tab:IDMbenchMarks}). Though the overall parameter space of IDM is 5-dimensional, once all relavant constraints are applied the parameter space relevant to a specific LHC signature typically reduces to 1-2 dimensional. In the mono-jet case, one can use two separate simplified models, a $gg \rightarrow h_1 h_1 + g$ process (via Higgs mediator) and a $qq \rightarrow h_1 h_2 + g (gq \rightarrow h_1 h_2 + q)$ process (through a Z-boson mediator) to capture the physics relevant to the search.
The cross sections for the various mono-$X$ and VBF signatures produced by this model are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:IDM_xsecs}.
