\section{\texorpdfstring{Implementation of \schannel and \tchannel models for \MET+X analyses}{Implementation of \schannel and \tchannel models for \MET+X analyses}}

There are several matrix element implementations of the
DM production through \spinzero and \spinone mediators. This Appendix collects the 
generator recommendations and available implementations
of these models for different final states, together with studies 
of the matching between the matrix element and the parton shower. 

\subsection{Implementation of models for mono-jet signature}
\label{sec:monojet_implementation}

For a \spinone mediator, the implementation in \powheg generates
DM pair production with 1 parton at next-to-leading order (NLO), 
whilst \madgraph and \mcfm are at leading order (LO)~\footnote{Spin-$0$ and \spinone 
mediator models will also be provided 
in the near future to the same precision in \madgraph~\cite{Alwall:1405.0301}.}. As shown in \powheg Ref.\,\cite{Haisch:2013ata}, including NLO corrections result in an enhancement in the cross section as compared to LO and though this is not significant, it does lead to a substantial reduction in the dependence on the choice of the renormalization and factorization scale and hence the theoretical uncertainty on the signal prediction. 
Since NLO calculations are available for the process in \powheg, we recommend to proceed with \powheg as the generator of choice. 

For a \spinzero mediator in the mono-jet final state, the top-quark loop is the most important consideration.
The matrix element implementation of the \schannel \spinzero mediated DM production is available in \mcfm~\cite{Fox:2012ru,Harris:2014hga} and \powheg~\cite{Haisch:2015ioa} with the full top-loop calculation at LO.
The \powheg and \mcfm implementations include the finite
top quark mass dependence for DM pair production with 1 parton at LO.
For consistency with the \spinone generation, we recommend using \powheg
for this case as well.

Here, we document some specific settings needed to run the \powheg 
generation for the Dark Matter models. POWHEG parameter cards for all models
can be found on the Forum SVN repository
~\cite{ForumSVN_DMA, ForumSVN_DMV, ForumSVN_DMS, ForumSVN_DMGG}.


\begin{itemize}
\item \powheg can handle the generation of events (be it at LO or NLO) 
in two different modes explained in the following. The second one 
is the recommended one. The relevant keywords in the input card are 
\bornsuppfact and \bornktmin. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item unweighted events: %keywords

\bornsuppfact: negative or absent\\
\bornktmin <PT>

This runs the program in the most straightforward way,
but most likely it is not the more convenient choice, as will be
explained below. \powheg will generate unweighted events using a sharp
lower cut (with value \texttt{PT}) on the leading-jet \pT. Since this is a
generation cut, the user should make sure that the value used for
\bornktmin is lower than the actual analysis cut to be eventually
used. It is good practice to use as a value in the input card a
transverse momentum 10-20\% smaller than the final analysis cut, and
check that the final result is independent, by exploring an even
smaller value of \bornktmin. The drawback of this running mode is that
it's difficult to populate well and in a single run both the low-\pT
region as well as the high-pT tail.

\item weighted events: %keywords

\bornsuppfact <PTS>\\
\bornktmin <PT>

\powheg will now produce weighted events, thereby allowing to generate
a single sample that provides sufficient statistics in all signal
regions. Events are still generated with a sharp lower cut set by
\bornktmin, but the \bornsuppfact parameter is used to set the event
suppression factor according to


\begin{equation}
F(\kT)=\frac{\kT^2}{\kT^2+\bornsuppfact^2} \;.
\end{equation}

In this way, the events at, for instance, low \MET, are suppressed
but receive an higher weight, which ensures at the same time higher
statistics at high \MET. We recommend to set \bornsuppfact to 1000.

The \bornktmin parameter allows to suppress the low \MET region
even further by starting the generation at a certain value of \kT also
in this running mode. It is recommended to set this parameter to half
the lower analysis \MET cut. For instance for the event selection used in the
CMS/ATLAS monojet analyses, assuming the lowest \MET region being defined above 300\,GeV, the proposed value for
\bornktmin is 150.  However, this parameter should be set keeping in
mind the event selection of all the analyses that will use these
signal samples and hence a threshold lower than 150 may be required.

\end{enumerate}

\Todo{Emanuele:``On the usage of fixed or running width. It is my opinion that one
should use fixed widths. Although clearly there are limitations, I
think this goes into the direction of making all as simple and
transparent as possible. Moreover, all the discussions in the last
months as well as the large majority of runs were done with fixed
widths. Since there was some interest over the last couple of weeks,
here is my suggestion for the POWHEG section.''}

\Todo{Steve:  The reason I originally asked the question was because we saw about 20 years ago that there were cases when using this prescription was important.  Now, this is mainly for SM particles, but we apply it throughout for non-SM ones.   If we find no significant difference, then we can say it.  But, if we are starting from scratch, why shouldn't we include as much correct physics as we can?}

%\begin{itemize}
\item Remove the \runningwidth keyword, or set it to 0, which is the
  default value. Running with fixed widths is the recommended
  option. Although there are limitations, this is the more
  straightforward, simple and transparent option, and it was used for
  Forum studies. 

  While not recommended, the alternative, a running width for the
  propagator of the \schannel mediator, can be selected by setting
  runningwidth to 1. In this case the denominator of the mediator's
  propagator
\begin{equation*}
  Q^2 - M^2 + \complexi\,M\,\Gamma
\end{equation*}

is replaced by

\begin{equation*}
  Q^2 - M^2 + \complexi\,Q^2\,\frac{\Gamma}{M}
\end{equation*}

where $Q$ is the virtuality of the mediator, and $M$ and $\Gamma$ are
its mass and width respectively.  See Ref.~\cite{Bardin:1989qr} for
a discussion.

\item Set the parameters defining the bounds on the invariant mass of the Dark Matter pair, \masslow and \masshigh, to -1. In this way, \powheg will assign values internally. 
\item The minimal values for \ncallOne, \itmxOne, \ncallTwo, \itmxTwo are 250000, 5, 1000000, 5 for the \modelDMV model, respectively.
\item The minimal values for \ncallOne, \itmxOne, \ncallTwo, \itmxTwo are 100000, 5, 100000, 5 for the \modelDMStloop model, respectively.
\item When NLO corrections are included (as for instance in the
  \modelDMV model), negative-weighted events could happen and should
  be kept in the event sample, hence \withnegweights should be set to
  1. If needed, their fraction can be decreased by setting \foldsci
  and \foldy to bigger value (2 for instance). \foldphi can be kept to
  1.
\item Since the \modelDMStloop model is a leading order process, set \LOevents and \bornonly are set to 1 internally.
\item One can benefit from the automatic calculation of systematic uncertainties associated with the choice of hard scale and PDFs as described in Section\,\ref{sec:TheoryUncertainties}.

Figure\,\ref{fig:monojet_narrow} suggests a change in the shape of the
\MET distribution for a $\mMed=5$~\tev mediator
once $\Gamma_{\rm{min}}/\mMed$ is of the order of a percent or lower.
Such heavy mediators, although inacessible by the LHC data, are interesting since they provide a good approximation for benchmark EFT models.
The observed difference among the simplified models in the plot arises from the fact that the region of low invariant masses of the Dark Matter pair, $m_{\bar{\chiDM}\chiDM}$, is suppressed due to narrow Breit-Wigner peak that only probes a narrow window of parton distribution functions. For wider mediators, the low mass region is significantly enhanced by parton distribution functions at low Bjorken $x$, as illustrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:monojet_mchichi}.
This explains why the sample with the narrowest mediator in Fig.\,\ref{fig:monojet_narrow} is heavily suppressed in terms of production cross section and also gives different \MET shape.
%In general, for such extreme parameter choices the EFT model should give the correct answer.
Furthermore, Fig.\,\ref{fig:monojet_narrow} compares the vector model with 5~\tev mediator to the D5 EFT sample and reveals that the simplified models with larger mediator widths (e.g. for couplings of 1) are the ones resembling the kinematics of contact interactions. This is because the production in the EFT model is always off-shell, i.e. no peak in the $m_{\bar{\chiDM}\chiDM}$ distribution is present.

However, the complete story of generating heavy narrow mediators is a cautionary tale
about understanding the details of the generator tools.
Observations of kinematic changes or cross section suppression in the generated samples do not always come from physics, but may be a consequence of under-sampling phase space in the generator implementation,
where a cutoff for the regions far away from the mediator mass is generally used. One must take care to correctly set the width of the Breit-Wigner used for the sampling.
This is illustrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:monojet_mchichi2} showing the invariant mass of the Dark Matter pair in the samples generated in \madgraph for a $\mMed=7$~\tev scalar mediator
with different coupling strengths, using the default settings \texttt{bwcutoff} equal to 15.
In all cases, it is expected to observe a peak around the mediator mass with a tail extending to $m_{\bar{\chiDM}\chiDM}\rightarrow0$, significantly enhanced by parton distribution functions at low Bjorken $x$. For coupling strength 1 and 3, the massive enhancement at $m_{\bar{\chiDM}\chiDM}\rightarrow0$ implies that
resonant production at $m_{\bar{\chiDM}\chiDM}=7$~\tev is statistically suppressed such that barely any events are generated there. However, for narrower mediators with couplings below 1, the peak around 7~\tev is clearly visible in the generated sample and the dominant tail at $m_{\bar{\chiDM}\chiDM}\rightarrow0$ is artificially cut off, leading to unphysical cross section predictions and kinematic shapes.

\subsection{Parton matching studies}
\label{sec:monojet_parton_match}

Whenever models for mono-jet final states are generated in  \madgraph,
it is necessary to avoid double counting the partons from matrix elements and parton showering in \pythiaEight
using a parton matching technique. Based on the comparative study 
in Ref.\,\cite{Alwall:0706.2569}, there is
some advantage to using the CKKW-L matching scheme.
%\cite{Alwall:1405.0301}
However, the current CKKW-L matching scheme is not amenable to the
event generation model of the experimental collaborations.
Most large scale event generation is performed using LHE files that
have a mix (or ``soup'') of different parton level processes in each file.
This is easy to handle using the MLM matching scheme provided as
a \pythiaEight plugin.

\subsubsection{Implementation of MLM matching}
\label{sec:match_implementation}

\Todo{This is probably a TODO for Steve M.}

Here, add the process generation steps, and the matching parameters for
LHE file production.  Also, provide the \pythiaEight configuration to
produce hadronic events.

The validation of matching has been performed extensively by the collaborations for a large number of SM and BSM models, and need not be reproduced here.


%% \subsubsection{Implementation of the CKKW-L matching}


%% To illustrate the settings related to parton matching, the EFT D5 samples are generated with \madgraph version 2.2.2 and showered in \pythiaEight.201. The technical implementation of the CKKW-L $k_t$-merging scheme is shown below.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item On the generator side:\\
%% \texttt{ickkw = 0} \\
%% \texttt{ktdurham = }matching scale \\
%% \texttt{dparameter = 0.4} \\
%% \texttt{dokt = T} \\
%% \texttt{ptj=20} \\
%% \texttt{drjj=0} \\
%% \texttt{mmjj=0} \\
%% \texttt{ptj1min=0} \\

%% \item On the parton showering side in \pythiaEight.201:\\
%% \texttt{Merging:ktType           = 1}\\
%% \texttt{Merging:TMS              = }matching scale\\
%% \texttt{1000022:all = chi chi\~{ } 2 0 0 30.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0}\\%, where 2 stands for the DM particle spin and 30 stands for its mass in GeV\\
%% \texttt{1000022:isVisible = false}\\
%% \texttt{Merging:doKTMerging      = on}\\
%% \texttt{Merging:Process          = pp>\{chi,1000022\}\{chi\~{ },-1000022\}}\\
%% \texttt{Merging:nJetMax          = 2}\\
%% \end{itemize}
%% The matching scales should be the same for the generation and parton showering. In \madgraph, the particle data group ID \texttt{1000022} is used for weakly interacting dark matter candidates. The dark matter particle is defined in \pythiaEight accordingly using the commands above that specify an invisible spin \textonehalf{} particle of 30\,\gev mass. The \texttt{Mergin:Process} command specifies the lowest parton emission process generated in \madgraph and \texttt{Merging:nJetMax = 2} gives the maximum number of additional parton emissions with respect to the lowest parton emission process. Therefore, the following three processes need to be generated in this case:\\

%% \texttt{p p > chi chi\~{ }}\\

%% \texttt{p p > chi chi\~{ } j}\\

%% \texttt{p p > chi chi\~{ } j j}\\
%% Note that the \madgraph cards and \pythiaEight commands are identical for all three samples.

%% \subsubsection{Matching scale}

%% In general, it is desired to take the hard parton emissions from the matrix element generation in \madgraph and allow \pythiaEight to take care of soft emissions only. The transition between these two regimes is defined by the matching scale and its optimal value can be determined by studying the cross-section as a function of the number of jets (differential jet rates). The differential rates $\frac{dN_{i\to j}}{d \log_{10}(k_\textrm{cut})}$ give the number of events which pass from $i$ jets to $j$ jets as the $k_t$ value increases beyond $k_\textrm{cut}$. An optimal matching scale should lead to smooth differential jet rates.

%% Two examples of differential jet rates, using matching scale 30\,\gev and 80\,\gev, from the EFT D5 sample generated as described in the previous section are given in Fig.\,\ref{fig:CKKW_D5_30} and \ref{fig:CKKW_D5_80}, respectively.
%% Although a kink is visible around the matching scale value in both cases, the 80\,\gev scale leads to smoother distributions. 
%% In order to find the optimal matching scale, additional samples with matching scale 50, 70, and 90\,\gev are generated as well and a detailed comparison of the differential jet rates close to the transition region is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:CKKW_D5_zoom}.
%% The largest differences among the samples are visible for the $1\rightarrow2$ jets transition where the 30\,\gev and 50\,\gev scale lead to a drop of the rates around the matching scale values. On the contrary, there is a hint of an increased rate around the matching scale value in the sample generated with the 90\,\gev scale. Therefore, we recommend to use 80\,\gev as the baseline matching scale.

%% \subsubsection{Parton emission multiplicity}
%% \label{sec:monojet_parton_emission}

%% The prescription for the event generation given in Section\,\ref{sec:match_implementation} starts with the emission of 0 partons and ends with maxim 2 partons in addition. Producing the samples separately allows to investigate the relative composition of the individual samples in various parts of the phase space. Figure\,\ref{fig:Kine_D5_80} shows the \MET distribution of the EFT D5 sample with the matching scale at 80\,\gev. The plot reveals that the 0-parton sample gives the dominant contribution in the region below the matching scale value that rapidly decreases at higher \MET. Assuming the lowest analysis \MET cut in Run-2 mono-jet analyses at 300\,\gev, the generation of the 0-parton emission sample can be safely omitted as it only gives $<1\%$ contribution at $\MET>300\,\gev$. For the 1- and 2-parton emission samples, one can use a generator cut on the leading parton $\pT$, \texttt{ptj1min}, in order to avoid generating low \MET events that are irrelevant for the analysis.

%% \end{figure}



In order to describe the signal kinematics correctly and save time during MC production, the parton emissions will only be generated up to a certain multiplicity. The higher multiplicity samples usually have small enough cross sections and the corresponding parts of the phase space can be sufficiently approximated by parton showering in \pythiaEight.
A dedicated study comparing samples generated with up to 1-, 2-, or 3-parton multiplicities was performed, using again the settings for the CKKW-L $k_t$-merging with the 80\,\gev matching scale and the \texttt{Merging:nJetMax} parameter adjusted accordingly.
Figure\,\ref{fig:RatioKine_D5} shows the \MET distribution of the samples at $\MET>250\,\gev$.

%While there is a $\sim10\%$ difference observed between the samples with up to 1 parton and up to 3 partons at low $\MET$, only marginal difference is seen between the samples generated with up to 2 and 3 partons.

With an event selection requiring \MET and the leading jet \pT being larger than $250\,\gev$ and allowing for up to 3 jets with $\pT>30\,\gev$, the sample generated with up to 1 parton has 17.4\% smaller yield compared to the sample with up to 3 partons, while the yield of the sample with up to 2 partons is only 2.2\% smaller.
Note the jet multiplicity cut is importnat here as the agreement between the two samples improves at higher \MET when the cut is not applied.
%At \MET>400\,\gev$, 0+1 parton emission has 16.8\% yield less and 0+1+2 parton emission has 2.4\% less compared to 0+1+2+3 parton emission. With $\MET>600\,\gev$, 0+1 parton emission has 16.5\% yield less and 0+1+2 parton emission has 2.9\% less compared to 0+1+2+3 parton emission. The same numbers hold if a symmetric cut is added on leading jet transverse momentum.
A similar comparison is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:RatioKine_D5_2} for the jet multiplicity in the events with the leadning jet $\pT>250\,\gev$, where an agreement at the level of $\sim3\%$ between the samples with up to 2 and 3 parton emissions is observed for number of jets up to 7.
This justifies it is sufficient to produce samples with up to 2 parton emissions only at the generator level and ignore generating higher parton emissions.

\label{sec:TTBar_implementation}

The models for the $t \bar{t}$ and $b \bar{b}$ signatures are generated at leading
order with \madgraph 2.2.2, using Pythia8 for the parton shower. No matching is needed. 
Parameter cards can be found on the Forum SVN repository~\cite{ForumSVN_DMTTBar}.
No parton matching is required. 

We simulate the bFDM model using the {\tt MG5\_aMC} v2.2.3, using Pythia8 for the parton shower. 
No matching is needed. The corresponding card files can be found 
on the Forum SVN repository~\cite{ForumSVN_DMSingleB}.

\subsubsection{Quark flavor scheme and masses}

In this particular model we recommend an additional care when choosing
the flavor scheme generation and whether quarks should be treated as massive or massless. 

The production of DM+$b\bar{b}$, Dark Matter in association with $b$ jets via a decay of a (pseudo) scalar boson, 
is dominated in simplified mediator models by the gluon-gluon initiated production, similar to the production of 
Z+$b\bar{b}$ at the LHC. The Z+$b\bar{b}$ process has been studied in detail in the Z(ll)+$b$-jets final state, 
which can be used to validate both the modeling of DM+bb and, its main background, Z(vv)+$b\bar{b}$. 
In this context, the $p_\textrm{T}$ of the Z boson is related to the observed MET, whereas the $b$-jet kinematics 
determines the ratio of mono-$b$/di-$b$ signatures in the detector.

%suggestion: could add diagrams for Z+bb and Phi+bb production here%

For basic kinematic criteria applied to Z+$b\bar{b}$ production, this process leads in $\sim90\%$ of 
the events to a signature with only 1 $b$-jet in the acceptance ('Z+1$b$-jet production') and only in 
$\sim10\%$ of the events to a signature with 2 $b$-jets in the detector ('Z+2$b$-jets production). 
The production cross section of the Z+$b\bar{b}$ process are calculated in the 'five-flavor scheme', 
where b quarks are assumed massless, and the 'four-flavor scheme', where massive b quarks are 
used~\cite{Campbell:2003dd,Maltoni:2005wd,Campbell:2005zv}, 
and data favor the cross-section predictions in the five-flavor scheme~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014dha}.
We therefore recommend to calculate the cross sections of these
models in the 5-flavor scheme, as in the repository. 
The PDF used to calculate these cross section is NNPDF3.0 (lhaid 263000). 

It is found that the best modeling of two $b$-quarks final states is achieved using a 4-flavor scheme and a massive treatment of the $b$-quarks ~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014dha,Chatrchyan:2013zja,CMS:2015mba}. We recommend to use in the generation NNPDF3.0 set (lhaid 263400).
Since figure~\ref{fig:4Fvs5F} shows that there is no significant difference in the kinematics between 
either flavor scheme used for DM+$b\bar{b}$ production, we recommend the 4-flavor scheme to follow
the observation in the Z+$b\bar{b}$ measurements. 

%Table~\ref{tab:xsec_dmbb_g1} gives the production cross sections for all recommended samples with $g_\textrm{DM}=g_\textrm{SM}=1$.

% We recommend to use in the generation NNPDF3.0 set (lhaid
%263400).
%In the $t bar t$ case we provide 
%values for the suggested coupling scan.

\subsection{Model implementation for mono-Higgs models}
\label{sub:monoHiggs}

All three Higgs+\MET models are generated at leading
order with \madgraph 2.2.2, using \pythiaEight for the parton shower. No matching is needed. 
The \madgraph implementations of the scalar and vector models can be found on the Forum SVN 
repository~\cite{ForumSVN_EWMonoHiggs}, while the 2HDM model can be found
at this link~\cite{ForumSVN_EWMonoHiggs_2HDM}.

In all cases, it is recommended not to handle the $h$ decay through \madgraph as
it does not include the proper $h$ branching ratios, or, if using \madgraph, then the 
resulting cross section should be rescaled to match onto the correct branching ratio.

\newthought{\madgraph details for scalar mediator Higgs+MET model}

In this model, the contribution from the $gghS$ box is included through an effective 
Lagrangian evaluated in the large $m_t$ limit. 
This may overestimate the rates of the $h + \MET$ signal~\cite{Haisch:2012kf}, but a full evaluation
is left to future studies. 

\newthought{\madgraph details for 2HDM Higgs+MET model}
  
 The two couplings that can be changed in the implemented model follow the nomenclature below:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \texttt{Tb} - $\tan \beta$
 	\item \texttt{gz} - $g_z$, gauge coupling of \Zprime to quarks
 \end{itemize}
 The other couplings are not changed, including \texttt{gx} (the $A \bar \chiDM \chiDM$ coupling) which has little impact on the signal. 
 $\sin \alpha$ is fixed internally such that $\cos (\beta-\alpha) = 0$. 
 The width of the \Zprime and $A$ can be computed automatically within \madgraph. 
 The couplings here don't affect the signal kinematics, so they can be fixed to default values 
 and then the signal rates can be scaled appropriately. 
 
The nomenclature for the masses in the implemented model is:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \texttt{MZp} - PDG ID 32 - \Zprime
 	\item \texttt{MA0} - PDG ID 28 - $A$
 	\item \texttt{MX} - PDG ID 1000022 - dark matter particle
 \end{itemize}
 
The other masses are unchanged and do not affect the result. 
 Both $\Zprime \to hZ(\bar \nu \nu)$ and  $\Zprime \to hA(\bar \chiDM \chiDM)$ contribute to the final state, scaling
 different with model parameters. We recommend to generate them separately, 
 and then add the two signal processes together weighted by cross sections.
 % These signals should be generated separately since they have different $\tan \beta, M_A$ dependence.  

\subsection{Implementation of EFT models}
\label{sub:EFTModels}

These models are generated at leading
order with \madgraph 2.2.2, using \pythiaEight for the parton shower. No matching is performed. 
Parameter cards can be found on the Forum SVN repository:~\cite{ForumSVN_EWMonoHiggs} for operators with Higgs+MET final states
and ~\cite{ForumSVN_EWEFTD7} for $W/Z/\gamma$ final states.
