Monojet searches are generally more sensitive
with respect to final states including bosons, due to the much
larger rates of signal events featuring quark or gluon radiation with
respect to radiation of bosons~\cite{Zhou:2013fla},
in combination with the low branching ratios if leptons from
boson decays are required in the final state.
The rates for the Higgs boson radiation is too low for these models
to be considered a viable benchmark~\cite{Carpenter:2013xra}.
However, the presence of photons,
leptons from W and Z decays,
and W or Z bosons decaying hadronically
allow backgrounds to be rejected more effectively,
making Z/gamma/W+MET searches
still worth comparing with searches in the jet+MET final state.
\Todo{Additional motivations exist for this final state from SUSY searches.}
%TODO: Linda is writing sentence to make this stronger.

\subsection{Vector mediator exchanged in the s-channel}

An example Feynman diagam for these processes can be constructed by taking
Fig.~\ref{fig:OP} and replacing the gluon with $\gamma,W$ or $Z$.
The interest for searches with W bosons in the final state
has been elevated by the increased cross section
for certain choices of couplings for a spin-1 mediator~\cite{Bai:2012xg}.
Run-1 searches have considered three sample cases for the product of
up and down quark couplings to the mediator, denoted as $\xi$:
\begin{itemize}
 \item No couplings between mediator and either up or down quarks~($\xi=0$);
 \item Same coupling between mediator and each of the quark types~ ($\xi=1$);
 \item Coupling of opposite sign between mediator and each of the quark types~($\xi=-1$).
\end{itemize}
The $\xi=-1$ case leads to a large increase in the cross-section of the process,
and modifies the spectrum of missing transverse energy or
transverse mass used for the searches. The sensitivity of the W+MET search for
this benchmark in this case surpasses that of the jet+MET search.
However, as shown in Ref.~\cite{Bell:2015sza}, the cross-section increase is due
to the production of longitudinally polarized W bosons,
as a consequence of a violation of electroweak gauge symmetries. Unless further
particles are introduced (in a fashion similar
to the Higgs boson in the Standard Model), choosing a value of $\xi=-1$
for this simplified model will lead to a manifest violation of unitarity at LHC energies.
The simplified model with a vector mediator exchanged in the s-channel model
can still be considered as a benchmark for searches with a W boson if $\xi=1$.
We leave the study of further models with cross-section enhancements due
to different couplings to up and down quarks for studies beyond the early LHC searches
covered in this document.
An example of such model is the case of both DM and SM Higgs charged under a new $U(1)'$,
with a a small mass mixing between SM Z-boson and the new $Z^\prime$. This leads
to different effective DM couplings to $u_L$ and $d_L$, proportional to
their coupling to the Z boson, detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:EWSpecificModels_Appendix}.

The scan in the parameters that characterize this simplified model for EW boson + MET
searches follow what is
already detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}.
%FIXME: refer to appropriate subsection

% CD: I tend to like this list so I'll leave it here in hope of recycling it
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item the mass of the DM particle ($m_{DM}$);
%  \item the mediator mass ($m_{Med}$);
%  \item the mediator width ($\Gamma_{Med}$);
%  \item the couplings between the DM and the mediator (\gdm),
%  and between the mediator and the initial state quarks ($g_{SM}$);
%  \item the chirality of the couplings between DM and mediator,
%  and between mediator and initial state quarks (vector-vector, axial-vector, axial-axial, vector-axial).
% \end{itemize}

As in the case of the jet+MET models, the width does not have a significant
impact on the kinematic distributions relevant for those searches. An example
of the particle-level analysis acceptance using the
generator-level cuts from Ref.~\cite{Aad:2014tda}
for the photon+MET analysis, but raising the photon $p_T$ cut
to 150 GeV is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DMV_EW_gamma_acceptance},
comparing a width that is set to $\Gamma=M_{med}/3$ to the
minimal width (the ratio between the two widths
ranges from 1.05 to 1.5 with increasing mediator masses).

\subsection{Scalar mediator exchanged in the s-channel}
\label{sub:EW_Scalar}

We recommend to generate this model for W, Z and photon searches 
in order to reproduce the kinematics of the dimension-5 contact operator
described in Section~\ref{sub:EW_EFT_Dim5} in a simplified model framework.
Results can then be recasted at the reinterpretation stage, by rescaling the cross-sections.  
The scan in \mdm and \mMed should follow the one in Table~\ref{fig:DMV_EW_gamma_acceptance}, 
although individual analyses may choose to reduce the granularity of the scan
according to their expected sensitivity. 

\subsection{Colored scalar mediator exchanged in the t-channel}

The model parameters with emission of an EW boson 
generally follow those in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels},
even though fewer diagrams are involved.   
A representative Feynman diagram can be
constructed by replacing a gluon in Fig.~\ref{fig:tchannelMonojet}
with a $\gamma,W,Z$ boson. See Ref.~\cite{Bell:2012rg} for a theoretical overview
of this model with specific examples for the Z+MET final state. 

Figure~\ref{fig:TChan_EW_Zhad_MET} shows the MET distribution for the hadronic Z+MET final state, 
with varying dark matter and mediator mass, before any selection. 
The acceptance for a series of simplified analysis cuts 
(MET$>$350 GeV, leading jet $p_T >$ 40 GeV, minimum azimuthal angle between jet and MET > 0.4) 
applied at the generator level is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TChan_EW_Zhad_acc}.

The parameter scan for the $t-$ channel model is still under discussion~\Todo{The parameter scan, 
	and the conclusions that can be drawn from the plots below, need to be
	cross-checked with those in the monojet channel.}

\subsection{Model implementation}

These models are generated at leading
order with MadGraph 2.2.2, using Pythia8 for the parton shower.
