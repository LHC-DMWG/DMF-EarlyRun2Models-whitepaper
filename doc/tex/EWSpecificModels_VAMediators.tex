All models detailed in this Section are applicable to signatures where 
 a photon, a W boson, a Z boson or a Higgs boson
 is radiated from the initial state partons instead of a gluon. 
The experimental signature is identified as \textit{V+\MET} and it
has been studied in Refs.~\cite{}.

Monojet searches are generally more sensitive
with respect to final states including bosons, due to the much
larger rates of signal events featuring quark or gluon radiation with
respect to radiation of bosons~\cite{Zhou:2013fla},
in combination with the low branching ratios if leptons from
boson decays are required in the final state.
The rates for the Higgs boson radiation is too low for these models
to be considered a viable benchmark~\cite{Carpenter:2013xra}.
However, the presence of photons,
leptons from W and Z decays,
and W or Z bosons decaying hadronically
allow backgrounds to be rejected more effectively,
making Z/gamma/W+\MET searches
still worth comparing with searches in the jet+\MET final state.

%\Todo{Additional motivations exist for this final state from SUSY searches.}
%TODO: Linda is writing sentence to make this stronger. 

% The three commonly chosen EFT benchmarks for Dirac dark matter that are
% kinematically distinct for what concerns the observables used in
% \MET+X searches~\footnote{[CD: we would need a plot here, or a reference to
% monojet section where this is shown]} and span a wide range of \MET spectrum in
% the boson+\MET searches are, in the notation of ~\cite{Goodman:2010ku},
% the D1 (scalar SM/WIMP interaction), D5 (vector-vector interaction) and D9
% (tensor interaction) operator.

In the case of a \spinone mediator,
an example Feynman diagram for these processes can be constructed by taking
Fig.~\ref{fig:OP} and replacing the gluon with $\gamma,W$ or $Z$.

When the initial state radiation is a $W^\pm$ boson, Run~1 searches have considered three benchmark cases adapted from the vector interaction in Ref. ~\cite{Bai:2012xg}, distinguished by $\xi$, the strength of the $d$ quark coupling relative the $u$ quark coupling:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[$\xi=0$:] Mediator couples to up-type or down-type quarks, but not both;
 \item[$\xi=1$:] Mediator couples to up-type and down-type quarks with same strength;
 \item[$\xi=-1$:] Mediator couples to up-type and down-type quarks with same strength, but opposite sign.
\end{itemize}

Contemplation of $\xi=-1$ heightened interest in searches for \spinone mediators with $W^\pm$ bosons in the final state. This choice enhances the cross-section significantly above the other choices and hardens the distribution of missing transverse energy used in the searches. The sensitivity of the $W+\MET$ search then surpasses that of the jet$+$\MET search. However, the situation $\xi=-1$ does not appear in an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-gauge-invariant simplified model.\sidenote{It is well-known that the diagrams in which the $W$ couples to $u$ and $\bar{d}$ have opposite sign. This is what gives rise to the ``helciity zero'' in $u \bar{d} \rightarrow W g$. The relative sign is set by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the statement that the mediator is an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ singlet. We can increase the cross section by changing the sign, but to do so we have to give the mediator some $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum number, making it, and the associated $\chi$, visible.} The simplified model with a vector mediator exchanged in the \schannel model is still viable when $\xi=1$. Ref.~\cite{Bell:2015sza} discusses the viability of departures $\xi < 1$ from both gauge-invariance and experimental points of view. An example of a model that arranges different effective DM couplings to $u_L$ and $d_L$ is detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:EWSpecificModels_Appendix}.

%The scan in the parameters that characterize this simplified model for EW boson + \MET
%searches follow what is
%already detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}.


% CD: I tend to like this list so I'll leave it here in hope of recycling it
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item the mass of the DM particle ($m_{DM}$);
%  \item the mediator mass ($m_{Med}$);
%  \item the mediator width ($\Gamma_{Med}$);
%  \item the couplings between the DM and the mediator (\gdm),
%  and between the mediator and the initial state quarks ($g_{SM}$);
%  \item the chirality of the couplings between DM and mediator,
%  and between mediator and initial state quarks (vector-vector, axial-vector, axial-axial, vector-axial).
% \end{itemize}

As in the case of the jet+\MET models, the width does not have a significant
impact on the kinematic distributions relevant for those searches. An example
of the particle-level analysis acceptance using the
generator-level cuts from Ref.~\cite{Aad:2014tda}
for the photon+\MET analysis, but raising the photon $p_T$ cut
to 150~\gev, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DMV_EW_gamma_acceptance},
comparing a width that is set to $\Gamma=M_{med}/3$ to the
minimal width (the ratio between the two widths
ranges from 1.05 to 1.5 with increasing mediator masses).
