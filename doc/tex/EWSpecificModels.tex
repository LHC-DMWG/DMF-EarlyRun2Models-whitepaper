%%Introduction

In this Section, we consider models with a photon, a W boson, a Z boson or a Higgs boson in the final state,
accompanied by Dark Matter particles that either couple directly to the boson or are mediated by
a new particle. The experimental signature is identified as \textit{V+MET}.

These models are interesting both as some are demanded by gauge coupling relations in models where the gluon provides
the experimentally detectable signature,
and also as stand-alone models with final states that cannot be generated by the models in
Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}.

The models considered can be divided in four categories:
\begin{description}
 \item[Models including a contact operator, where the boson is radiated from the initial state] As depicted in
 the top diagram of Figure~\ref{fig:VPlusMET_EFT}, these models follow the nomenclature and theory
 for the EFT benchmarks commonly used by MET+X searches~\cite{Goodman:2010ku}. These models
 have been used in past experimental searches~~\cite{Khachatryan:2014rwa, Aad:2014vka,Khachatryan:2014tva, Aad:2014vka,
 ATLAS:2014wra, Aad:2013oja}, and they will not be described here.
 \item[Models including a contact operator, where the boson is directly coupled to DM]
 Shown in the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:VPlusMET_EFT},
 these models allow for a contact interaction vertex that directly couples the boson to Dark Matter.
 \item[Simplified models where the boson is radiated from the initial state] These models follow those
 already described in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}, replacing the initial state gluon with a boson.
 \item[V-specific simplified models] These models postulate direct couplings of new mediators
 to bosons, e.g. they couple the Higgs boson to a new scalar~\cite{Carpenter:2013xra}.
\end{description}

The following Sections describe the models within these categories,
the parameters for each of the benchmark models chosen,
the studies towards the choices of the parameters to be scanned,
and finally point to the location of their Matrix Element
implementation.

\newthought{Simplified models with ISR boson radiation}

Searches in the jet+MET final state are generally more sensitive
with respect to final states including bosons, due to the much
larger rates of signal events featuring quark or gluon radiation with
respect to radiation of bosons~\cite{Zhou:2013fla},
in combination with the low branching ratios if leptons from
boson decays are required in the final state.
The rates for the Higgs boson radiation is too low for these models
to be considered a viable benchmark~\cite{Carpenter:2013xra}.
However, the presence of photons
leptons from W and Z decays
and W or Z bosons decaying hadronically
allows to reject the background more effectively, making Z/gamma/W+MET searches
still worth comparing with searches in the jet+MET final state.

% The three commonly chosen EFT benchmarks for Dirac dark matter that are
% kinematically distinct for what concerns the observables used in
% MET+X searches~\footnote{[CD: we would need a plot here, or a reference to
% monojet section where this is shown]} and span a wide range of MET spectrum in
% the boson+MET searches are, in the notation of ~\cite{Goodman:2010ku},
% the D1 (scalar SM/WIMP interaction), D5 (vector-vector interaction) and D9
% (tensor interaction) operator.

\paragraph{Vector mediator exchanged in the s-channel}

The case for searches with W bosons in the final state has so far been strenghtened by the
presence of particular choices of couplings between the WIMP and the up and
down quarks which enhance W radiation~\cite{Bai:2012xg}, in the case of the exchange
of a vector mediator in the s-channel.
Run-1 searches have considered three sample cases for the product of
up and down quark couplings to the mediator $\xi$:
\begin{itemize}
 \item No couplings between mediator and either up or down quarks~($\xi=0$);
 \item Same coupling between mediator and each of the quark types~ ($\xi=1$);
 \item Coupling of opposite sign between mediator and each of the quark types~($\xi=-1$).
\end{itemize}
The $\xi=-1$ case leads to a large increase in the cross-section of the process,
and modifies the spectrum of missing transverse energy or
transverse mass used for the searches. The sensitivity of the W+MET search for
this benchmark in this case surpasses that of the jet+MET search.
However, as shown in Ref.~\cite{Bell:2015sza}, the cross-section increase is due
to the production of longitudinally polarized W bosons,
as a consequence of a violation of electroweak gauge symmetries. Unless further
particles are introduced (in a fashion similar
to the Higgs boson in the Standard Model), choosing a value of $\xi=-1$
for this simplified model will lead to a manifest violation of unitarity at LHC energies.
The simplified model with a vector mediator exchanged in the s-channel model
can still be considered as a benchmark for searches with a W boson if $\xi=1$.
We leave the study of further models with cross-section enhancements due
to different couplings to up and down quarks for studies beyond the early LHC searches
covered in this document.
An example of such model is the case of both DM and SM Higgs charged under a new U(1)',
with a a small mass mixing between SM Z-boson and the new Zprime. This leads
to different effective DM couplings to $u_L$ and $d_L$, proportional to
their coupling to the Z boson, detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:EWSpecificModels_Appendix}.

The scan in the parameters that characterize this simplified model for EW boson + MET
searches follow what already detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}.
%FIXME: refer to appropriate subsection

% CD: I tend to like this list so I'll leave it here in hope of recycling it
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item the mass of the DM particle ($m_{DM}$);
%  \item the mediator mass ($m_{Med}$);
%  \item the mediator width ($\Gamma_{Med}$);
%  \item the couplings between the DM and the mediator ($g_{DM}$),
%  and between the mediator and the initial state quarks ($g_{SM}$);
%  \item the chirality of the couplings between DM and mediator,
%  and between mediator and initial state quarks (vector-vector, axial-vector, axial-axial, vector-axial).
% \end{itemize}

As in the case of the jet+MET models, the width does not have a significant
impact on the kinematic distributions relevant for those searches. An example
of the particle-level analysis acceptance using the
generator-level cuts from Ref.~\cite{Aad:2014tda}
for the photon+MET analysis, but raising the photon $p_T$ cut
to 150 GeV is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DMV_EW_gamma_acceptance},
comparing a width that is set to $\Gamma=M_{med}/3$ to the
minimal width (the ratio between the two widths
ranges from 1.05 to 1.5 with increasing mediator masses).

\newthought{EFT models with direct DM-boson couplings}

A complete list of effective operators with direct DM/boson couplings for
Dirac DM, up to dimension 7, can be found in~\cite{Cotta:2012nj}.

The lowest dimension benchmark operators we may consider are effective dimension 5.  Following the notation of~\cite{Carpenter:2012rg},  models
from this category have a Lagrangian that includes terms such as:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{m_W^2}{\Lambda_5^3} ~\bar{\chi} \chi ~W^{+ \mu} W^{-}_\mu
+ \frac{m_Z^2}{2 \Lambda_5^3} ~ \bar{\chi} \chi ~ Z^\mu Z_\mu ~.
\end{eqnarray}

where $m_Z$ and $m_W$ are the masses of the $Z$ and $W$ boson, $W^{\mu}$ and $Z^{\mu}$
are the fields of the gauge bosons, $\chi$ denote the Dark Matter fields
and $\Lambda_5$ is the effective field theory scale.  Note that these operators are of true dimension 7, but reduce to effective dimension 5 once Higgs vevs, contained in the W and Z mass terms, are inserted.  As such , one expects  these that operators would naturally  arise in UV complete models where Dark Matter interacts via a Higgs portal where heavy mediators would couple to the Higgs or other fields in an extended Higgs sector. In such models the full theory may be expected to contain additional operators with Higgs-Dark Matter couplings. Concentrating  for the moment on mono-gauge boson signals, the above operator induces signatures with MET in conjunction with Z and W bosons at tree level,
while at loop level it induces couplings to photon pairs and $Z \gamma$ through W loops.
In these models, a clear relation exists between final states with photons, EW bosons
and Higgs boson. \textbf{[TODO: see if mono-Higgs studies exist for these operators, include them here]}.

The dimension-7 benchmark models  contain the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge-invariant couplings between DM fields and the kinetic terms of the EW bosons. The CP-conserving scalar couplings of this type can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lc1c2}
\frac{c_1}{\Lambda_S^3} \, \bar \chi \chi \, B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu }  + \frac{c_2}{\Lambda_S^3} \, \bar \chi \chi \, W_{\mu \nu}^i W^{i, \mu \nu }  \,.
\end{equation}
Here $B_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu$ and $W_{\mu \nu}^i =  \partial_\mu W_\nu^i - \partial_\nu W_\mu^i + g_2 \hspace{0.25mm} \epsilon^{ijk}  \hspace{0.25mm}  W_\mu^j \hspace{0.25mm} W_\mu^k$ are the $U(1)_Y$ and $SU(2)_L$ field strength tensor, respectively, and  $g_2$ denotes the weak coupling constant. In the case of the pseudoscalar couplings, one has instead
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lc3c4}
\frac{c_1}{\Lambda_P^3} \, \bar \chi \gamma_5 \chi \, B_{\mu \nu} \tilde B^{\mu \nu }  + \frac{c_2}{\Lambda_P^3} \, \bar \chi \gamma_5 \chi \, W_{\mu \nu}^i \tilde W^{i, \mu \nu }  \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde B_{\mu \nu} = 1/2 \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon_{\mu \nu  \lambda \rho}  \hspace{0.25mm}  B^{\lambda \rho}$ and $\tilde W_{\mu \nu}^i = 1/2 \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon_{\mu \nu  \lambda \rho}  \hspace{0.25mm}  W^{i, \lambda \rho}$ are the dual  field strength tensors. In addition to the CP-conserving interactions (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) and (\ref{eq:Lc3c4}), there are also four CP-violating couplings that are obtained from the above operators by the replacement $\bar \chi \chi \leftrightarrow \bar \chi \gamma_5 \chi$.

The effective interactions introduced in (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) and  (\ref{eq:Lc3c4}) appear  in models of Rayleigh DM~\cite{Weiner:2012cb}. Ultraviolet completions where the operators are generated through loops of states charged under $U(1)_Y$ and/or $SU(2)_L$  have been proposed in \cite{Weiner:2012gm} and their LHC signatures have been studied in \cite{Liu:2013gba}. If these new charged particles  are  light, the high-$p_T$ gauge bosons that participate in  the MET processes considered here are able to resolve the substructure of the loops. This generically suppresses the cross sections compared to the EFT predictions~\cite{Haisch:2012kf}, and thus will weaken the bounds on the interaction strengths of  DM and the EW gauge bosons  to some extent.  Furthermore, the light charged mediators may be produced  on-shell in $pp$ collisions, rendering direct LHC searches potentially more restrictive than MET searches. Making the above statements precise would require further studies beyond the timescale of this forum.

Since for $\Lambda_S = \Lambda_P$ the effective interactions (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) and (\ref{eq:Lc3c4}) predict essentially the same value of the mono-photon, mono-$Z$ and mono-$W$ cross section \cite{Carpenter:2012rg,Crivellin:2015wva}, we consider below only the former couplings. We emphasise however that measurements of the jet-jet azimuthal angle difference in  MET$+ 2 j$ events may be used to disentangle whether DM couples more strongly to the combination $B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu}$ ($W_{\mu \nu}^i W^{i, \mu \nu }$) or the product $B_{\mu \nu} \tilde B^{\mu \nu}$ ($W_{\mu \nu}^i \tilde W^{i, \mu \nu }$) of field strength tensors \cite{Cotta:2012nj,Crivellin:2015wva}.


After EW symmetry breaking the interactions (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) induce direct couplings between pairs of DM particles and  gauge bosons.  The corresponding Feynman rule reads
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:feynman}
\frac{4 \hspace{0.25mm} i}{\Lambda_S^3} \; g_{V_1 V_2} \, \big (  p_1^{\mu_2} \hspace{0.25mm} p_2^{\mu_1} - g^{\mu_1 \mu_2}  \, p_1 \cdot p_2 \big ) \,,
\end{equation}
where $p_i$ ($\mu_i$) denotes the momentum (Lorentz index) of the vector field $V_i$ and for simplicity the spinors associated with the DM fields have been dropped. The couplings $g_{V_i V_j}$ take the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gViVj}
\begin{split}
g_{\gamma \gamma} & = c_w^2 \hspace{0.25mm} c_1+ s_w^2  \hspace{0.25mm} c_2 \,, \\[1mm]
g_{\gamma Z}   & = - s_w c_w \, \big (  c_1  - c_2  \big ) \,, \\[1mm]
g_{ZZ}  & = s_w^2 \hspace{0.25mm} c_1 + c_w^2  \hspace{0.25mm} c_2  \,, \\[1mm]
g_{WW} & = c_2 \,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $s_w$ ($c_w$) the sine (cosine) of the weak mixing angle. Note that our coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ are identical to the coefficients $C_B$ and $C_W$ used in \cite{Crivellin:2015wva}, while they are related via $k_1 = \frac{1}{{c_w}^2} c_1$ and $k_2 = \frac{1}{{s_w}^2} c_2$ to the coefficients $k_1$ and $k_2$ introduced in \cite{Carpenter:2012rg}.

The coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ appearing in (\ref{eq:gViVj}) determine the relative importance of each of the MET channels and their correlations. For example, one observes that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Only $c_2$ enters the coupling between DM and $W$ bosons, meaning that only models with $c_2 \neq 0$ predict a mono-$W$ signal;
 \item If $c_1 = c_2$ the mono-photon (mono-$Z$) signal does not receive contributions from diagrams involving $Z$ (photon) exchange;
  \item Since numerically $c_w^2/s_w^2 \simeq 3.3$ the mono-photon channel is particularly sensitive to $c_1$.
\end{itemize}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EW_EFT5_Zlep_MET}
kinematics of this model can be approximated by that of a simplified model including
a high-mass scalar mediator exchanged in the s-channel. For this reason,
the list of benchmark models with direct boson-DM couplings only includes dimension 7 operators.
\textbf{[TODO: then we need to recommend the scalar mediator,
but then the sensitivity is very poor wrt monojets - however, I still prefer
to generate a few (high-mass) simplified model points wrt an EFT if given the choice.]}

    a dimension-5 scalar contact operator, in the leptonic Z+MET final state}
    \label{fig:EW_EFT5_Zlep_MET}
\end{figure}

The kinematic distributions for dimension-7 scalar and pseudoscalar operators
only shows small differences, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EW_EFT5_gamma_MET}.

\end{figure}

Similarly, the differences in kinematics for the various signatures
are negligible when changing the coefficients $k_1$ and $k_2$, as shown
in Figure~\ref{EFTD7_EW_kinematics}. Only the case $k_1=k_2=1$ is generated as benchmark;
other cases are left for reinterpretation as they will only need a rescaling of the cross-sections
shown in Table~\ref{} \textbf{[TODO: add tables with cross sections]} for the various Dark Matter
mass points considered.

Higgs portals with scalar mediators are among the most concise versions of simplified models that produce couplings of Dark Matter to pairs of gauge-bosons.  Scalar fields may couple directly to pairs of electroweak gauge bosons, but must carry part of the electroweak vev.  One may thus consider a simple model where Dark Matter couples to a a scalar singlet mediator, which mixes with the fields in the Higgs sector.
\begin{equation}
L\subset m_s S^2 + \lambda S^2H^2 +\lambda^{'} S H^2 + y S \chi \overline{\chi}
\end{equation}
Where H is a field in the Higgs sector that contains part of the electroweak vev, S is a heavy scalar singlet and $\chi$ is a Dark Matter field. 
There is then an S channel diagram where DM pairs couple to the singlet field S, which then mixes with a  Higgs-sector field, and couples to W and Z bosons.  This diagram contains 2 insertions of EW symmetry breaking fields.  This diagram corresponds in form  to the  effective dimension-5 operator in the previous section.

For both jet+MET and boson+MET searches, the kinematic of this operator corresponds to that of couplings that are vector-axial (D7), axial-axial (D8) and axial-vector (D6).

This operator has the lowest cross-section and sensitivity at colliders in this final state, as DM production from light quarks via a scalar interaction is suppressed with respect to heavy quarks. However, it has the hardest MET spectrum of the EFT operators chosen, and results obtained using this operator as benchmark may be used for recasting signals with a similarly hard MET distribution.~\footnote{Q for Andy/M-E: ZZchichi max gamma: is it the same kinematics regardless of DM?
