%%Introduction

In this Section, we consider models with a photon, a W boson, a Z boson or a Higgs boson in the final state,
accompanied by Dark Matter particles that either couple directly to the boson or are mediated by
a new particle. The experimental signature is identified as \textit{V+MET}.

These models are interesting both as some are demanded by gauge coupling relations in models where the gluon provides
the experimentally detectable signature,
and also as stand-alone models with final states that cannot be generated by the models in
Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}.

The models considered can be divided into four categories:
\begin{description}
 \item[Models including a contact operator, where the boson is radiated from the initial state] As depicted in
 the left diagram of Figure~\ref{fig:VPlusMET_EFT}, these models follow the nomenclature and theory
 for the EFT benchmarks commonly used by MET+X searches~\cite{Goodman:2010ku}. These models
 have been used in past experimental searches~\cite{Khachatryan:2014rwa, Aad:2014vka,Khachatryan:2014tva, Aad:2014vka,
 ATLAS:2014wra, Aad:2013oja}, and they will not be described here~\cite{Cotta:2012nj, Carpenter:2012rg, Crivellin:2015wva,Berlin:2014cfa}.
 \item[Simplified models with a boson radiated either from the initial state or from the mediator] These models follow those
 already described in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}, replacing the gluon with a boson.
 \item[Models including a contact operator, where the boson is directly coupled to DM]
 Shown on the right-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:VPlusMET_EFT},
 these models allow for a contact interaction vertex that directly couples the boson to Dark Matter.
 \item[V-specific simplified models] These models postulate direct couplings of new mediators
 to bosons, e.g. they couple the Higgs boson to a new vector or to a new scalar~\cite{Carpenter:2013xra,Berlin:2014cfa}. 
\end{description}

The following Sections describe the models within these categories,
the parameters for each of the benchmark models chosen,
the studies towards the choices of the parameters to be scanned,
and finally point to the location of their Matrix Element
implementation.

% \begin{description}
%  \item[Vector interaction with vector-vector couplings (D5)]. For both jet+MET and boson+MET searches, the kinematic of this operator corresponds to that of couplings that are vector-axial (D7), axial-axial (D8) and axial-vector (D6). In the case of W boson radiation, the three coupling scenarios $\xi=1,0,-1$ should be investigated. This operator populates the high MET
%  \item[Tensor interaction (D9)]. As shown in Figure \textbf{[CD: add picture from Andy]}, this operator populates a higher MET range with respect to the other operators chosen.
%  \item[Scalar interaction (D1)]. This operator has the lowest cross-section and sensitivity at colliders in this final state, as DM production from light quarks via a scalar interaction is suppressed with respect to heavy quarks. However, it has the hardest MET spectrum of the EFT operators chosen, and results obtained using this operator as benchmark may be used for recasting signals with a similarly hard MET distribution.~\footnote{Q for Andy/M-E: ZZchichi max gamma: is it the same kinematics regardless of DM? See fig. 2 of ATLAS monoZ.}
