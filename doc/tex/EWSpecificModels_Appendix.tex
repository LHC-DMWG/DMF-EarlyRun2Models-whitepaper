\section{Further W+MET models with possible cross-section enhancements} 

%Contributed by Yang Bai

As pointed out in Ref.~\cite{Bell:2015sza}, the mono-$W$ signature can probe the iso-spin violating interactions of dark matter with quarks. The relevant operators after the electroweak symmetry breaking is 
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}\overline{\chi} \gamma_\mu \chi \left( \overline{u}_L \gamma^\mu u_L + \xi \bar{d}_L \gamma^\mu d_L \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
Here, we only keep the left-handed quarks because the right-handed quarks do not radiate a $W$-gauge boson from the weak interaction. As the LHC constraints the cutoff to higher values, it is also important to know the corresponding operators before the electroweak symmetry. At the dimension-six level, the following operator
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{c_6}{\Lambda^2}\overline{\chi} \gamma_\mu \chi \,\overline{Q}_L \gamma^\mu Q_L 
\end{equation}
%
conserves iso-spin and provides us $\xi=1$~\cite{1503.07874}. At the dimension-eight level, new operators appear to induce iso-spin violation and can be
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{c^d_8}{\Lambda^4}\overline{\chi} \gamma_\mu \chi \,(H\overline{Q}_L) \gamma^\mu (Q_L H^\dagger) 
+ \frac{c^u_8}{\Lambda^4}\overline{\chi} \gamma_\mu \chi \,(\tilde{H}\overline{Q}_L) \gamma^\mu (Q_L \tilde{H}^\dagger)  \,.
\end{equation}
% 
After inputting the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, we have 
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{c_6 \,+\, c_8^d\,v_{\rm EW}^2/2\Lambda^2}{c_6 \,+\, c_8^u \,v_{\rm EW}^2/2\Lambda^2} \,.
\end{equation}
% 
For a nonzero $c_6$ and $v_{\rm EW} \ll \Lambda$, the iso-spin violation effects are suppressed. On the other hand, the values of $c_6$, $c^d_8$ and $c^u_8$ depend on the UV-models. 

There is one possible UV-model to obtain a zero value for $c_6$ and non-zero values for $c^d_8$ and $c^u_8$. One can have the dark matter and the SM Higgs field charged under a new $U(1)^\prime$. There is a small mass mixing between SM $Z$-boson and the new $Z^\prime$ with a mixing angle of ${\cal O}(v_{\rm EW}^2/M^2_{Z^\prime})$. After integrating out $Z^\prime$, one has different effective dark matter couplings to $u_L$ and $d_L$ fields, which are proportional to their couplings to the $Z$ boson. For this model, we have $c_6=0$ and 
 %
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \sin^2{\theta_W} }{ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} \sin^2{\theta_W}} \approx  -2.7 
\end{equation}
%
and order of unity.
