Dark matter has not yet been seen in particle physics experiments, and
there is not yet any evidence for non-gravitational interactions between dark
matter and Standard Model particles.  If such interactions exist,
pairs of dark matter particles could be produced at the LHC, leading
to signatures including one or more hard objects~\footnote{In the case of a single hard object, 
	these signatures are commonly called 'mono-X'.} in association with
missing transverse energy (\MET{} + X). 

Early Run 1 searches for \MET{}+X signatures at ATLAS and CMS employed
a set of effective field theories (EFTs) \cite{Goodman:2010ku} to
model the possible signals. If a contact interaction is the correct
description of dark matter pair production at colliders, the missing
energy distribution of the signal depends only on the mass of the dark
matter particles and the spin structure of the interaction; only the
overall rate is a free parameter. Both experiments studied a variety
EFTs with different spin structures. Provided the contact interaction
approximation holds, these EFTs also provide a straightforward way to
translate results amongst LHC results and the different types of
non-collider searches for dark matter.

From the Run 1 results, however, it has become clear
\cite{Busoni:2013lha} that a contact interaction is often not the
correct description for the signals to which the LHC is truly
sensitive. The LHC is exploring a regime where the mediating process
may play a significant role, leading to signals that can
be kinematically distinct from those predicted by the EFT, as well as
qualitatively different signatures requiring new search
strategies. While the EFT integrates out the degrees of freedom of the
(heavy) intermediate particle, ``simplified models''
\cite{Alves:2011wf} with directly-accessible mediators describe this
richer phenomenology. Such models can be used both to interpret \MET{}+X
searches and to guide the design of complementary searches for
additional signatures. 

Many proposals for such models began to emerge, for example
Refs. \cite{An:2012va,An:2012ue,Tait:2013,Buchmueller:2013dya,Bai:2013iqa,Bai:2014osa,An:201489115014,Yavin:14092893,Malik:2014ggr,Harris:2014hga,Buckley:2014fba}
and, at the end of 2014, ATLAS and CMS organized a forum, the
ATLAS-CMS Dark Matter Forum, to form a consensus with the
participation of experts on theories of dark matter. This is the final
report of that forum.

One of the guiding principles of this report is to channel the efforts
of the ATLAS and CMS Collaboration towards a minimal set of dark
matter models that should influence the design of the early Run-2
searches, rather than providing exhaustive and elaborate
interpretations and re-interpretations of the results. At the same
time, a thorough survey of realistic collider signals of dark matter
is a crucial input to the overall design of the search program.

The goal of this report is such a survey, though confined within some
broad assumptions and focused on benchmarks for kinematically-distinct
signals which are most urgently needed. As far as time and resources
have allowed, the assumptions have been carefully motivated by
theoretical consensus and comparisons of simulation. But to achieve a
true consensus with only a few months before Run 2 would begin, it was
important to narrow the scope and timescale to the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A prioritized, small set of benchmark simplified models should
  be agreed upon by both collaborations for Run-2 searches.
\item The matrix element implementation of the simplified models
  should be standardized, and other common technical details (order of
  the calculation, showering) harmonized as much as practical. The forum should 
  outline a common choice of LO/NLO, ME-parton
  shower matching and merging, factorization and renormalization
  scales for each of the simplified models. This leads to a
  single set of theory uncertainties, which will be easier to deal
  with when comparing results from the two collaborations.
\item The forum should also discuss the conditions under which the EFT
  interpretation may still be desirable.
\item The forum should prepare a report summarizing these items,
  suitable both as a reference for the internal ATLAS and CMS
  audiences and as an explanation for theory and non-collider
  readers. This report represents the views of the participants of the
  forum.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Grounding Assumptions}

The first choice made for the Run-2 benchmarks is on the nature of the
Dark Matter itself: it is assumed to be a particle, stable on collider
timescales and non-interacting with the detector, and a Dirac fermion.
The latter is a practical choice, given that the Forum relied upon a
large body of theoretical work which made this assumption. Many of the
conclusions in this report also apply to \MET{} signals of
Majorana fermion DM or scalar DM with some minor modification to
account for their different angular distributions, especially when
considering cut-and-count analyses. Thus the choice of Dirac fermion
dark matter is deemed sufficient for the benchmarks aiding the design
of the upcoming Run-2 searches. Nevertheless, a more complete set of
models will certainly be required upon a discovery, as physics observables
may be used to distinguish the spin of the DM particle~\cite{Crivellin:2015wva}. 

We also assume that Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) applies to the
recommended models. This means that the flavor structure of the
couplings between dark matter and ordinary particles follows the
structure as the Standard Model. This choice is both natural, as there
is no required additional theory of flavor beyond what is already
present in the SM, and and it ensures that the
models do not violate flavor constraints.  As a consequence, spin-0
resonances exchanged in the \schannel must have Yukawa couplings to SM
fermions. Flavor-safe models can still be constructed beyond the MFV
assumption~\cite{Agrawal:2014aoa}, but their phenomenology is left for
future studies.
%cite Dolan:2014ska? Also DM@LHC report, if out in time. 

In the parameter scan for the recommended models, we make the
assumption of minimal width for the particles mediating the
interaction between SM and DM.  This means that only the decays that
are strictly necessary for the self-consistency of the model (e.g.  to
DM and to quarks) are accounted for in the definition of the mediator
width. In turn, this forbids any further decays of the mediator to other invisible
particles of the Dark Sector that may increase its width. However,
studies within the Forum show that, for many models in the cut and count analyses, the
kinematic distributions and therefore the sensitivity
of the search do not depend significantly on the mediator width up to
extreme values where the particle nature of the mediator comes into
question.

The particle content of the models chosen as benchmarks is limited to
one single kind of DM whose self-interactions are not relevant for LHC
phenomenology, and to one type of SM/DM interaction at a time. These
assumptions only add a limited number of new particles to the
SM. These simplified models, independently sought by different
experimental analyses, can be used as starting points to build more
complete theories. Even though this factorized picture does not always
lead to full theories and leaves out details that are necessary for
the self-consistency of single models (e.g. the mass generation for
mediator particles), it is a starting point to prepare a set of
distinct but yet complementary collider searches for Dark Matter, as
it leads to benchmarks that are easily comparable across channels.

%CD: added after Rizzo's comments. Not sure it belongs here
Contact interaction operators (EFTs) are also suggested wherever 
neither a simplified model completion nor simplified model operators 
yielding similar kinematic distributions are available.
This is the case for dimension 5-7 operators with direct 
Dark Matter-electroweak boson couplings. 
Model-independent results should be emphasized 
in the signal regions that are unique to these models, 
and results should be considered with the necessary caution due to EFT 
validity issues covered in the last chapter in this report. 

\section{Structure of this document}

The first chapter of the report is dedicated to simplified
models with radiation of a hard object either from the initial state
or from the mediator. These models produce primarily monojet signatures, 
but are recommended for all \MET{}+X searches.
Details of the implementation of these models in
Monte Carlo generators are provided in
Appendix \ref{app:MonojetLikeModels_Appendix}.
Chapter~\ref{subsec:DMHFModels} describes the specific details of the general models
for final states including heavy flavor quarks, leaving the implementation
details to appendix~\ref{app:TTBar_Xsecs}.  
Chapter~\ref{subsec:EWSpecificModels} contains the benchmark model
recommendations and choices for final states containing an electroweak 
boson ($W/Z/gamma/H$). 
Simplified models from chapter~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}
are considered, together with specific simplified models leading to mono-boson signatures
and contact interaction operators wherever simplified models are not available. 
The technical implementation and further models that can be studied
beyond early searches are in appendix~\ref{app:EWSpecificModels_Appendix}. 
The final chapter is devoted to the treatment of the validity of benchmark
models from contact interaction operators.
Appendix~\ref{app:Presentation_Of_Experimental_Results} contains the necessary elements that
should be included in the results of experimental searches to allow for further reinterpretation.
