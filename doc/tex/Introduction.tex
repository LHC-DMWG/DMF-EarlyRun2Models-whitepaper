This document presents recommendations for
the Monte Carlo (MC) production and parameter scans
for various theoretical models of Dark Matter production
at hadron colliders.  In particular, the document is
intended to be a reference for dataset generation of
Dark Matter models for the early stages of Run-2 at the LHC.

What is the motivation for this report?

First, the physics is compelling. Measurements at the energy frontier
can make quantitative statements about the possible interactions of
dark matter with the particles of the Standard Model.

Second, in Run-1 at the LHC, there was confusion in the community
over the interpretation of the data.

Third, there are reasons to strive for uniformity in interpretation
in the different experiments.  This will ultimately aid in the
combination of data, but also facilitates cross checks of results.

What is the format of this report?

First, it describes the signatures and models of interest for
dark matter searches during Run-2 at the LHC.

Secondly, it provides information on the tools to be used to
simulate signals and related uncertainties.

Finally, it makes a recommendation on a scan of parameters within
those models based on supporting material.

Accompanying this document is a short summary containing only the
implementation instructions necessary for the two collaborations to
prepare Monte Carlo simulation.
