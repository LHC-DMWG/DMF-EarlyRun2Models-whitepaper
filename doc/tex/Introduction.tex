This document presents recommendations for
the MC production and parameter scans
for the various simplified models.

What is the motivation for this report?

First, the physics is compelling.   Measurements at the energy
frontier can make quantitative statements about dark matter.

Second, in Run-1 at the LHC, there was confusion in the community
over the interpretation of the data.

Third, there are reasons to strive for uniformity in interpretation
in the different experiments.  This will ultimately aid in the
combination of data, but also facilitates cross checks of results.

What is the format of this report?

First, it describes the signatures and models of interest for
dark matter searches.

Secondly, it provides information on the tools to be used to
simulate signals.

Finally, it makes a recommendation on a scan of parameters within
those models based on supporting material.
