Models of bottom-flavored Dark Matter that are closely related to the \tchannel mediated model from this 
Section have been proposed in Refs.~\cite{Lin:2013sca,Agrawal:2014una}. 
Here, DM couples preferentially to bottom quarks, with a decoupled third generation. 
We describe the $b$-FDM model of Ref.~\cite{Agrawal:2014una}, created to explain the Galactic Center (GC) 
gamma-ray excess observed in data collected by the Fermi-LAT collaboration~\cite{Daylan:2014rsa,Calore:2014xka}. 
This model favors couplings to third-generation quarks via Yukawa couplings, 
therefore respecting the MFV assumption. 

%CD Removed after B. Zaldivar's comments
%This model produces an annihilation cross section consistent with the gamma-ray excess
%which can be achieved for perturbative
%values of the couplings, while being consistent with LHC constraints on the
%colored mediator
%For parameters capable of explaining the anomalous gamma-ray signal in terms of Dark Matter 
%coupling preferentially to $b$-quarks, the model predicts a direct detection cross section that is consistent 
%with current constraints, but within the near future reach of Direct Detection experiments and of the
%upcoming LHC run. 
%The model will be decisively tested with data from the upcoming high-energy run at the LHC. 

The model contains a Dirac fermion transforming as a flavor triplet, exclusively coupling
to right-handed down-type quarks. The third component of the triplet $\chi_b$ comprises the 
cosmological DM. Within the MFV framework, the other fermions in the flavor triplet can be 
made sufficiently heavy and weakly-coupled that they can be neglected in the analysis.
A flavor singlet, color triplet scalar field $\Phi$ mediates the interactions between the DM 
and the Standard Model quarks.  The model is similar to the MSSM with a light bottom squark and neutralino, 
and is thus a flavor-specific example of a \tchannel model. 
Similar top-flavored models can exist, as e.g. in Refs.~\cite{Kumar:2013hfa,Batell:2013zwa}. 
In the case where the top coupling is the main DM coupling, 
the signal is very similar to a signal from a stop quark, since unlike the other t-channel cases there is no top
in the initial state parton distribution functions (PDFs). This is the reason why it wasn't considered as an additional model. More recent
literature shows that other flavor states could also contribute to LHC signals, as shown in Ref.~\cite{Kilic:2015vka},
but such models will have to be investigate on a longer timescale with respect to that of this Forum. 

The Lagrangian considered is given by
\begin{equation}
  {\cal L} \supset g \Phi^* \bar\chi_b b_R  + {\rm h.c.}
\end{equation}

%The QCD production of the colored mediator introduces a tree-level $b$+MET diagram with a $g_s*g$ dependence, which could be scaled. 
%However, the bb+MET (which often also falls in the b+MET signal region) has both pure QCD production of the colored mediator 
%($g_s^2$) and also possibly diagrams that scale as $g_s^2*g$.

This model is known at LO+PS accuracy, and the studies in this Section use a LO model implementation within \madgraph v2.2.3
interfaced to \pythiaEight for the parton shower. Further implementation details can be found in Section~\label{sec:TTBar_implementation}.
 

\subsubsection{Parameter scan}

In this model, the interference of diagrams with QCD production of the mediator (which scale as $g^2_s$) with diagrams that are proportional to the coupling $g$ in the $b+$\MET{} and $b\bar{b}$+\MET{} final states. In the case of large couplings, this is not conducive to a simple scaling behavior that would allow us to reduce the number of points to be simulated. 
%Fixing the couplings also fixes the mediator width, when adopting the minimal width assumption. 

A full study of the parameter scan for this model was not available for this report; thus for early Run-2 searches we recommend scanning a range of possible widths as discussed in a more limited way than for the \tchannel mono-jet, spanning from the minimal width to a value approaching the particle limit, e.g. $g=0.5,1,2,3$. A coupling benchmark such as $g=1$ should be considered for each mass point since this would be a distinctive feature of this benchmark from SUSY models with sbottom squarks (see Section~\ref{sec:monojet_t_channel} for further discussion).
%: Cross-sections for unit couplings can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:xsecs_bFDM}. 
%The coupling could also be chosen to fulfill constraints from the relic density (see Appendix~\ref{app:Relic_Density_bFDM}, with corresponding cross sections in Tables~\ref{tab:g_relic_13T} onwards). 

A scan of Dark Matter and mediator masses should be done in the on-shell region $\MPhi > \mDM + m_b$, since the cross-sections in the off-shell region are too small to be probed with early LHC data, spanning from 10 to 500 GeV in \mDM and from 10 to 1300 GeV in \MPhi. 

%  \item $\mDM=10-500$ GeV with a binning of 50 GeV for $\mDM<100$ and  100 GeV otherwise; 
%  \item $\MPhi=10-1300$ with a binning of 100 GeV;

% Therefore, the coupling scan is chosen as a discrete set of values $g=0.5,1,2,3$ for each mass point.
%~\Todo{Are we sure the models in SVN have minimal width? What is the max coupling so that the width is still lower than the mass?}

%The increase in the center of mass energy from 8 to 13 TeV leads to a cross-section increase that is a function of \MPhi, 
%with a smaller dependency for \mDM. Therefore, the sensitivity to this model will increase in early 13~TeV data compared to 8 TeV searches~\cite{Aad:2014vea}.
