A model of bottom-flavored Dark Matter ($b$-FDM) has been proposed in Ref.~\cite{Agrawal:2014una} to explain the Galactic Center (GC) gamma-ray excess observed in data collected by the Fermi-LAT collaboration~\cite{Daylan:2014rsa}.

The increase from 8 to 13 TeV will lead to large cross section improvements, as shown in Appendix~\ref{app:xsecs_bFDM}. 
%Production of heavier mediators requires high $x$ in the PDFs, and 
The increase in the center of mass energy leads to a cross-section increase that is a function of $m_\Phi$, with a smaller dependency for $m_{\rm DM}$. Therefore, the sensitivity to this model will increase in early 13~TeV data compared to the 8 TeV searches~\cite{Aad:2014vea}.

The model contains a Dirac fermion transforming as a flavor triplet. The third component of the triplet $\chi_b$ comprises the cosmological DM. A flavor singlet, color triplet scalar field $\Phi$ mediates the interactions between the DM and the Standard Model quarks.The model is similar to the MSSM with a light bottom squark and neutralino, and is thus a flavor-specific
example of a $t$-channel model. 

The Lagrangian considered is given by
\begin{equation}
  -{\cal L} \supset g \Phi^* \chi_b b_R  + {\rm h.c.}
\end{equation}
Within the framework of minimal flavor violation, the other fermions in the flavor triplet can be made sufficiently heavy and weakly-coupled that they can be neglected in the analysis.

%Although the model is motivated by the GC excess, which prefers a DM mass of 30-70 GeV, the DM mass parameter of the model is a free parameter and all values $ m_b < m_{\chi_b} < m_\Phi -m_b$ should be considered.\Todo{Off-shell?}

An annihilation cross section consistent with the gamma-ray excess can be achieved for perturbative values of the couplings while being consistent with LHC constraints on the colored mediator. For parameters capable of explaining the anomalous gamma-ray signal in terms of Dark Matter coupling preferentially to $b-$ quarks, the model predicts a direct detection cross section that is consistent with current constraints, but within the near future reach of Direct Detection experiments. The model will be decisively tested with data from the upcoming high-energy run at the LHC. 

\section{Parameter scan}

The nature of the model doesn't allow to derive a simple scaling behaviour which would allow us reduce the number of points to be simulated. This is because of the interference of diagrams with QCD production of the mediator (which scale as $g^0$) with diagrams that scale with $g$.~\todo{Does the kinematic always change with mDM and coupling, in all cases? This model is close to a $t-$channel colored scalar mediator so the conclusions should be similar.}

The coupling can be chosen as a discrete set of values $g=0.5,1,2,3...$ for each mass point, which would allow a bound on $g$ to be determined.  The coupling could also be chosen to fullfill constraints from the relic density (see Appendix~\ref{app:Relic_Density_bFDM}, with corresponding cross sections in Tables~\ref{tab:g_relic_13T}-\ref{tab:g1_8T}). A sizable, $O(1)$ coupling benchmark such as $g=1$ should be considered for each mass point since this would be a distinctive feature of this benchmark from SUSY models with sbottom squarks.

In light of these considerations, we recommend to produce the following benchmark points in the parameter space for this model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $m_\textrm{DM}=10-500$ GeV with a binning of 50 GeV for $m_\textrm{DM}<100$ and  100 GeV otherwise  
  \item $m_\Phi=10-1300$ with a binning of 100 GeV.
  \item $m_\Phi > m_{DM} + m_b$ \Todo{why this? May be trivial...}.
  \item \Todo{What about the coupling scan?}
\end{itemize}

Cross-sections for unity couplings can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:xsecs_bFDM}.

\section{Model implementation}

\todo{Do you have to match with Pythia PS? Do you have any recommendations on the initial state PDFs?}

We simulate the model using the {\tt MG5\_aMC} v2.2.3. The corresponding card files can be found 
on the Forum SVN repository~\ref{ForumSVN_DMSingleB}.
