The first part of this Chapter describes details of the models from in Section~\ref{sec:monojet_scalar}, with 
emphasis on heavy flavour final states that arise due to the Yukawa couplings of SM quarks to the mediator. 
In addition, simplified models yielding signatures of a single top of bottom quark in the final state are outlined 
in Sections~\ref{sec:singletop, sec:singleb}. 
These models are not as generally applicable as those in the rest of this report, as they make a number of 
assumptions to enhance the production of these specific final states, but they are included as they still provide a 
unique search signature. Presentation of model-independent results is strongly encouraged to allow for further 
reinterpretation that relaxes some of the assumptions in these models.
