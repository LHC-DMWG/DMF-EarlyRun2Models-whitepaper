A complete list of effective operators with direct DM/boson couplings for
Dirac DM, up to dimension 7, can be found in~\cite{Cotta:2012nj, Carpenter:2012rg, Crivellin:2015wva}. 
Higher dimensional operators, up to dimension 8, leading to Higgs+MET signatures,
are mentioned in~\cite{Carpenter:2012rg, Berlin:2014cfa}.
Despite the appearance of simplified models, we argue that
the model independent approach of the EFTs is still relevant.
Furthermore, not all EFT operators have a simplified model
replacement.


%%%%%%%%%%%Dimension 5 operators
\subsection{Dimension 5 operators}
\label{sub:EW_EFT_Dim5}

The lowest dimension benchmark operators we may consider are effective dimension 5,
such as the one depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:modelMonoHEFT}.

	\caption{Diagram for EFT operators giving rise to a Higgs+MET signature.}
	\label{fig:modelMonoHEFT}
\end{figure}

Following the notation of~\cite{Carpenter:2012rg},  models
from this category have a Lagrangian that includes terms such as:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{m_W^2}{\Lambda_5^3} ~\bar{\chi} \chi ~W^{+ \mu} W^{-}_\mu
+ \frac{m_Z^2}{2 \Lambda_5^3} ~ \bar{\chi} \chi ~ Z^\mu Z_\mu ~.
\end{eqnarray}

where $m_Z$ and $m_W$ are the masses of the $Z$ and $W$ boson, $W^{\mu}$ and $Z^{\mu}$
are the fields of the gauge bosons, $\chi$ denote the Dark Matter fields
and $\Lambda_5$ is the effective field theory scale~Todo{Nomenclature differs: $\Lambda_5$ vs $\lambda$}. Note that these operators are of true dimension 7, 
but reduce to effective dimension 5 once Higgs vevs, contained in the W and Z mass terms, are inserted.  
As such, one expects  these that operators would naturally arise in UV complete models where Dark Matter 
interacts via a Higgs portal where heavy mediators would couple to the Higgs or other fields in an extended Higgs sector. 
In such models the full theory may be expected to contain additional operators with Higgs-Dark Matter couplings. 

Concentrating  for the moment on mono-gauge boson signals, the above operator induces signatures with 
MET in conjunction with Z and W bosons at tree level,
while at loop level it induces couplings to photon pairs and $Z \gamma$ through W loops.
In these models, a clear relation exists between final states with photons, EW bosons
and Higgs boson. 

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EW_EFT5_Zlep_MET}
kinematics of this model can be approximated by that of a simplified model including 
a high-mass scalar mediator exchanged in the s-channel. For this reason, 
the list of benchmark models with direct boson-DM couplings for photon, Z and W 
only includes dimension 7 operators: the scalar model with initial state radiation of an EW boson
is already recommended and its results can be rescaled. The Higgs+MET analysis,
however, will not consider the scalar simplified model as benchmark, due to the very low sensitivity 
in early LHC analyses, and will instead use this dimension 5 operator.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Parameter scan}

The two parameters of this model are the scale of new physics $\lambda$ 
and the DM particle mass. SM-DM coupling and new physics scale are related by 
$\gdm = \frac{(246 GeV)}{\lambda}$\Todo{Clarify the reason why this happens 
	in Madgraph through explicit Lagrangian terms?}.

The initial value of the new physics scale $\lambda$ chosen 
for the sample generation is 3 TeV; this does not affect the signal kinematics, 
and the cross-section of the samples can be rescaled according to the 
$\lambda^3$ dependence when deriving the constraints on this scale. 
%From Andy
%– Lambda=3 TeV. Essentially this is an arbitrary choice for most EFTs, 
%however it does affect the mono-H analysis as some of their models 
%have non-trivial scaling with Λ. More care should be given to the choice for mono-H. 

The DM mass values for the benchmark points to be simulated are chosen to
span a sufficient Dark Matter range leading to different kinematics, 
that is within the LHC sensitivity for early searches and that is consistent across 
the various signatures and EFT operators. We therefore start the mass scan
at \mdm=1 GeV, where collider experiments are complementary to direct and indirect detection
%TODO: we could kill the 1 GeV as the kinematics does not change from 10
and choose the last point corresponding to a DM mass of 1 TeV. 
We recommend a scan in seven mass points, namely:
$$
\mdm = { 1, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1300 } GeV. 	
$$

A set of kinematic distributions from the Higgs+MET signature where the Higgs decays 
into two $b-$quarks is shown in Fig.~\ref{eq:Lc1c2}, for points similar to those of the grid scan proposed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%Dimension 7 operators

\subsection{Dimension 7 operators}
\label{sub:EW_EFT_Dim7}

% +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The dimension-7 benchmark models  contain the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge-invariant couplings between 
DM fields and the kinetic terms of the EW bosons. The CP-conserving scalar couplings of this type can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lc1c2}
\frac{c_1}{\Lambda_S^3} \, \bar \chi \chi \, B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu }  + \frac{c_2}{\Lambda_S^3} \, \bar \chi \chi \, W_{\mu \nu}^i W^{i, \mu \nu }  \,.
\end{equation}
Here $B_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu$ and $W_{\mu \nu}^i =  \partial_\mu W_\nu^i - \partial_\nu W_\mu^i + g_2 \hspace{0.25mm} \epsilon^{ijk}  \hspace{0.25mm}  W_\mu^j \hspace{0.25mm} W_\mu^k$ are the $U(1)_Y$ and $SU(2)_L$ field strength tensor, respectively, and  $g_2$ denotes the weak coupling constant. In the case of the pseudoscalar couplings, one has instead
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lc3c4}
\frac{c_1}{\Lambda_P^3} \, \bar \chi \gamma_5 \chi \, B_{\mu \nu} \tilde B^{\mu \nu }  + \frac{c_2}{\Lambda_P^3} \, \bar \chi \gamma_5 \chi \, W_{\mu \nu}^i \tilde W^{i, \mu \nu }  \,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde B_{\mu \nu} = 1/2 \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon_{\mu \nu  \lambda \rho}  \hspace{0.25mm}  B^{\lambda \rho}$ and $\tilde W_{\mu \nu}^i = 1/2 \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon_{\mu \nu  \lambda \rho}  \hspace{0.25mm}  W^{i, \lambda \rho}$ are the dual  field strength tensors. In addition to the CP-conserving interactions (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) and (\ref{eq:Lc3c4}), there are also four CP-violating couplings that are obtained from the above operators by the replacement $\bar \chi \chi \leftrightarrow \bar \chi \gamma_5 \chi$.

The effective interactions introduced in (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) and  (\ref{eq:Lc3c4}) appear  in models of Rayleigh DM~\cite{Weiner:2012cb}. Ultraviolet completions where the operators are generated through loops of states charged under $U(1)_Y$ and/or $SU(2)_L$  have been proposed in \cite{Weiner:2012gm} and their LHC signatures have been studied in \cite{Liu:2013gba}. If these new charged particles  are  light, the high-$p_T$ gauge bosons that participate in  the MET processes considered here are able to resolve the substructure of the loops. This generically suppresses the cross sections compared to the EFT predictions~\cite{Haisch:2012kf}, and thus will weaken the bounds on the interaction strengths of  DM and the EW gauge bosons  to some extent.  Furthermore, the light charged mediators may be produced  on-shell in $pp$ collisions, rendering direct LHC searches potentially more restrictive than MET searches. Making the above statements precise would require further studies beyond the timescale of this forum.

Since for $\Lambda_S = \Lambda_P$ the effective interactions (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) and (\ref{eq:Lc3c4}) predict essentially the same value of the mono-photon, mono-$Z$ and mono-$W$ cross section \cite{Carpenter:2012rg,Crivellin:2015wva}, we consider below only the former couplings. We emphasise however that measurements of the jet-jet azimuthal angle difference in  MET$+ 2 j$ events may be used to disentangle whether DM couples more strongly to the combination $B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu}$ ($W_{\mu \nu}^i W^{i, \mu \nu }$) or the product $B_{\mu \nu} \tilde B^{\mu \nu}$ ($W_{\mu \nu}^i \tilde W^{i, \mu \nu }$) of field strength tensors \cite{Cotta:2012nj,Crivellin:2015wva}.

After EW symmetry breaking the interactions (\ref{eq:Lc1c2}) induce direct couplings between pairs of DM particles and  gauge bosons.  The corresponding Feynman rule reads
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:feynman}
\frac{4 \hspace{0.25mm} i}{\Lambda_S^3} \; g_{V_1 V_2} \, \big (  p_1^{\mu_2} \hspace{0.25mm} p_2^{\mu_1} - g^{\mu_1 \mu_2}  \, p_1 \cdot p_2 \big ) \,,
\end{equation}
where $p_i$ ($\mu_i$) denotes the momentum (Lorentz index) of the vector field $V_i$ and for simplicity the spinors associated with the DM fields have been dropped. The couplings $g_{V_i V_j}$ take the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gViVj}
\begin{split}
g_{\gamma \gamma} & = c_w^2 \hspace{0.25mm} c_1+ s_w^2  \hspace{0.25mm} c_2 \,, \\[1mm]
g_{\gamma Z}   & = - s_w c_w \, \big (  c_1  - c_2  \big ) \,, \\[1mm]
g_{ZZ}  & = s_w^2 \hspace{0.25mm} c_1 + c_w^2  \hspace{0.25mm} c_2  \,, \\[1mm]
g_{WW} & = c_2 \,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $s_w$ ($c_w$) the sine (cosine) of the weak mixing angle. Note that our coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ are identical to the coefficients $C_B$ and $C_W$ used in \cite{Crivellin:2015wva}, while they are related via $k_1 = \frac{1}{{c_w}^2} c_1$ and $k_2 = \frac{1}{{s_w}^2} c_2$ to the coefficients $k_1$ and $k_2$ introduced in \cite{Carpenter:2012rg}.

The coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ appearing in (\ref{eq:gViVj}) determine the relative importance of each of the MET channels and their correlations. For example, one observes that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Only $c_2$ enters the coupling between DM and $W$ bosons, meaning that only models with $c_2 \neq 0$ predict a mono-$W$ signal;
 \item If $c_1 = c_2$ the mono-photon (mono-$Z$) signal does not receive contributions from diagrams involving $Z$ (photon) exchange;
  \item Since numerically $c_w^2/s_w^2 \simeq 3.3$ the mono-photon channel is particularly sensitive to $c_1$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter scan}

As stated above and shown in Ref.~\cite{Nelson:2013pqa}, 
the kinematic distributions for dimension-7 scalar and pseudoscalar operators
only shows small differences. This has been verified from a generator-level study:
the signal acceptance after a simplified analysis selection 
(MET$>$350 GeV, leading jet $p_T > $ 40 GeV, minimum azimuthal difference between
either of the two jets and the MET direction $>$ 0.4) is roughly 70\% for both. 
We therefore only suggest to generate one of the two models. 
Todo{When we have the cross-sections for both, we can recommend the one with the highest cross-section.}

%as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EW_EFT5_gamma_MET}.

%    operators with direct interaction between DM and photon, in the photon+MET final state}
%    \label{fig:EW_EFT5_gamma_MET}
%\end{figure}

The differences in kinematics for the various signatures
are negligible when changing the coefficients $k_1$ and $k_2$, as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:EFTD7_EW_kinematics}. Only the case $k_1=k_2=1$ is generated as benchmark;
other cases are left for reinterpretation as they will only need a rescaling of the cross-sections
shown in Appendix~\ref{app:EWSpecificModels_Appendix} for the various DM
mass points considered.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%Dimension 8 operators

\subsection{Higher dimensional operators}

Many higher dimensional operators can induce signals of photons or $W/Z/H$ bosons
in the final state. A complete list can be found in Refs.~\cite{Carpenter:2013xra, Berlin:2014cfa, Petrov:2013nia}
and references therein. 

Although with lower priority with respect to the operators above, 
a representative dimension-8 operators can be chosen as benchmark, with the form:
 
$$\frac{1}{\Lambda^4} \bar{\chi} \gamma^{\mu} \chi B_{\mu \nu} H^{\dagger} D^{\nu} H$$

In this case, the new physics scale is $\Lambda$ is connected with the coupling
of the DM as $y_{\chi} = \frac{1}{\Lambda^{4}}$.Todo{Is more detail needed here?}
An advantage of this operator is that it includes all signatures with EW bosons,
allowing to assess the relative sensitivity of the various channels with the same model.  
The kinematics for this operator is different with respect to other operators,
leading to a harder MET spectrum, 
as illustrated by comparing the leading $b-$jet distribution for the dimension 5 operator
to the dimension 8 operator.

\subsection{Validity of EW contact operators and possible completions}
\label{sub:validityEWContact}

It is important to remember that the operators described in 
this section may present problems in terms of the validity of the contact interaction
approach for the energy scales reached at the LHC. 

As outlined in~\cite{Berlin:2014cfa}, designing very high MET search signal regions
that are exclusively motivated by the hard MET spectra of the dimension 7 and 8 operators
will mean that the momentum transfer in the selected events is larger. This in turn
means that processes at that energy scale (mediators, particles exchanged in loops)
are accessible, and a simple contact interaction will not be able to correctly
describe the kinematics of these signals. 

Contact interaction operators like the ones in this section 
remain useful tools for comparison of the sensitivity of different search channels, 
and for reinterpretation of other models under the correct assumptions. 
To date, there are no UV-complete models available for most of those operators:
the dimension-7 operators are particularly challenging since their completion involves loops.
However, this may be the focus of future theoretical exploration: 
an example of a complete model 
for scalar DM corresponding to the dimension-5 operator 
is provided in the Appendix~\ref{app:EWSpecificModels_Appendix}. 
\Todo{Add references from Uli's paper, Rayleigh DM}.
Providing results for the pure EFT limit of these models will prove useful
to cross-check the implementation of future. 

Given these considerations, the recommendations on the presentation of the results
for these models are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Assess the percentage of events that pass the EFT validity condition, and present results using a truncation of the invalid events using the procedure in Section~\ref{sec:EFTValidity} alongside pure EFT results;
\item Deliver fiducial limits on the cross section of any new physics events, without any model assumption, according to the guidelines in Appendix~\ref{app:Presentation_Of_Experimental_Results}.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model implementation}

These models are generated at leading
order with MadGraph 2.2.2, using Pythia8 for the parton shower.
Parameter cards can be found on the Forum SVN repository:~\cite{ForumSVN_EWEFTD7} for dimension 5 operators
and ~\cite{ForumSVN_EWEFTD7} for dimension 7.
