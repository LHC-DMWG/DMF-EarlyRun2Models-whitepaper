%\section*{EFT Validity and Truncation Summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most of this report has focused on simplified models.
Here, we wish to emphasize the utility and applicability of
Effective Field Theories (EFTs) 
in the interpretation of DM searches at the LHC.
Given our current lack of knowledge about the nature of a DM particle and
its interactions, a model independent interpretation of the collider bounds
appears mandatory. This approach should be complemented with
an interpretation within a choice of simplified models, which however
cannot exhaust the set of possible completions of
an effective Lagrangian. 
Even though the EFT requires an assessment of the conditions that define its applicability, 
results provided using of a single simplified model at a time do not
characterize the full breadth of an EFT that can represent results for many completions at once.  
In some cases, such as composite WIMPs~\cite{}, 
\Todo{CD: Asked Tim for reference}
the contact interaction framework is the correct one to constrain new confinement scales. 

%Even when the application of EFT is not appropriate for the prediction of kinematics 
%or cross sections, it does predict specific final states and can motivate experimental searches.

One problem that has arisen is the attempt to derive a limit on
nucleon-dark matter scattering cross sections based on collider data.
Experiments that directly probe the nucleon-dark matter scattering cross section 
are testing the regime of small momentum transfers, where the EFT approximation always holds.  
Collider experiments are sensitive to large momentum transfers: This is a regime where careful 
treatment is necessary since the condition of applicability of the EFT may not hold~\footnote{
Furthermore, mapping EFT results from high to low momentum requires particular care for some of the operators, 
see Ref.~\ref{D'Eramo:2014aba} for a thorough discussion.}.

%As we have learned, EFTs do not truly represent a model-independent representation of the data for the current collider sensitivity.
Ideally, experimental constraints should be shown as bounds of allowed signal events in the kinematic regions considered for 
the search, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:Presentation_Of_Experimental_Results}. 
Constraints comparing different experiments should be expressed as a function of the model parameters 
rather than on related observables, where the complementarity still be manifest, although this is a point
that should be developed further after the conclusion of the work of this Forum. 
Analyses should do this systematically; until that is done, results can be presented using one 
of the several prescriptions in the literature~\cite{Busoni:2013lha,Busoni:2014sya,Busoni:2014haa,Aad:2015zva,Racco:2015dxa}. 
that can be used to quote bounds on EFT operators. 

We first illustrate the problem that can arise with EFTs at colliders by considering an effective interaction
$$ (\bar\psi\psi)(\bar\chiDM\chiDM) {g\over \Lambda^2}$$
that couples SM and DM fields.   The strength of this interaction can
be parametrized by $\displaystyle f={g\over \Lambda^2}$.
A monojet signature can be generated
by applying perturbation theory in the QCD coupling (assuming $\psi$ is
a quark, for example).
An experimental search will place a limit on $f$.   
For a fixed $f$, a small value of $g$ will correspond
to a small value of $\Lambda$.   The EFT approximation breaks down
if $Q>\Lambda$, where $Q$ is a typical hard scale of the process.
One possible example is $\Qtr^2=p(\bar\chiDM\chiDM)^2$, i.e.
the momentum flow through
the \schannel.
Thus the limit on small $g$ can only be reliable if the
kinematic region $Q>\Lambda$ is removed from the prediction.
On the other hand, if, for the same value of $f$, a large $\Lambda$
is assumed so that the full kinematic region can be used, a large value of
$g$ is required, raising the question if perturbation theory
is even applicable.     

In the first part of this Section, we summarize some methods that can be used to
improve the reliability of the EFT approximation. These methods are described in detail in Refs.~\cite{Busoni:2013lha,Busoni:2014sya,Busoni:2014haa,Aad:2015zva,Racco:2015dxa,Berlin:2014cfa}. 
We then propose a recommendation for the presentation of EFT results for early Run-2 LHC searches.

\label{sec:TruncationWithQTr}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A standard approach has been to consider a simplified model and use the connection that the model provides between
mediator mass and scale of the interaction to determine the reliability of the EFT approximation.
For a tree-level interaction between DM and the Standard Model (SM) via some mediator with mass \mMed, 
the EFT approximation corresponds to expanding the propagator for the mediator
in powers of $\Qtr^2/\mMed^2$, truncating at lowest order, and combining the remaining parameters into a single parameter \Mstar (also called $\Lambda$ in the literature).
For an example scenario with a \Zprime-type mediator (leading to some combination of operators D5 to D8 in the EFT limit)
this corresponds to setting
 
\be
\frac{\gDM \gq}{Q_{\rm tr}^2-M^2}=-\frac{\gDM \gq}{M^2}\left(1+\frac{Q^2_{\rm tr}}{M^2}+ \mathcal{O} \left(\frac{Q^4_{\rm tr}}{M^4}\right)\right) \simeq -\frac{1}{{\Mstar}^2},
\ee
%
where $\Qtr$ is the momentum carried by the mediator, and $\gDM$, $\gq$ are the DM-mediator and quark-mediator couplings respectively. Similar expressions exist for other operators. Clearly the condition that must be satisfied for this approximation to be valid is that $\Qtr^2 < M^2 = \gDM \gq {\Mstar}^2$. 
In this framework, there are three regions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Qtr^2 \sim M^2$, in which case the EFT misses a resonant enhancement, and it is conservative to ignore this enhancement;
\item $\Qtr^2 \ll M^2$, in which case the EFT is a good approximation; and
\item $\Qtr^2 \gg M^2$, in which case the signal cross section should fall according to a power of $\Qtr^{-1}$ instead of $M^{-1}$.   This is the problematic kinematic region.
\end{itemize}

We can use the condition $\Qtr^2 < M^2 = \gDM \gq {\Mstar}^2$ to restrict the
kinematics of the signal and remove events for which the high-mediator-mass approximation made in the EFT would not be reliable.
This leads to a smaller effective cross-section, after imposing the event selection of the analysis.  This truncated signal can then be used to derive a new, more conservative limit on $\Mstar$ as a function of $(\mDM, \gDM \gq)$.
%TODO SM: I am uncomfortable with saying ``ensure the validity.'' CD: me too. However "improve the reliability of the validity" is cumbersome so I changed it.

For the example D5-like operator, $\sigma \propto {\Mstar}^{-4}$, and so there is a simple rule for converting a rescaled cross section into a rescaled constraint on ${\Mstar}$ if the original limit is based on a simple cut-and-count procedure. Defining $\sigma_{\rm EFT}^{\rm cut}$ as the cross section truncated such that all events pass the condition $\sqrt{\gDM \gq} \Mstar^{\rm rescaled} > \Qtr$, we have
 
\be
\Mstar^{\rm rescaled} = \left(\frac{\sigma_{\rm EFT}}{\sigma_{\rm EFT}^{\rm cut}}\right)^{1/4} \Mstar^{\rm original},
\ee
%
which can be solved for $\Mstar^{\rm rescaled}$ via either iteration or a scan.
%(note that $\Mstar^{\rm rescaled}$ appears on both the LHS and RHS of the equation).
Similar relations exist for a given UV completion of each operator. The details and application of this procedure to ATLAS results can be found in Ref.~\cite{Aad:2015zva} for a range of operators. Knowledge of the UV completion for a given is necessary for this procedure; this introduces a model-dependence that was not present in the not-truncated EFT results. 

%CD: Tim's reasoning is below. 
%You argued (well, reported on an argument) that the use of the EFT somehow is a barrier to collider searches being appreciated by colleagues who work on other detection strategies.  Of course, I do not know what the future will hold under any scenario, but I strongly believe that the rejection of the collider bounds is based entirely on politics by the direct detection community, who feels threatened that it weakens their designs to expand to lower mass.  Of course, so far they are getting funding to do that anyway, so they should not feel threatened, but they do not want the competition.
%
%My prediction is that by going from an EFT to a simplified model, the response from colleagues in other fields will be that the mapping is (self-evidently) model-dependent, and therefore they do not want to include it since it is at odds with their “direct” limits.  This objection is essentially false in the sense that even when they compare one experiment to each other, it is model-dependent, but it is true that the model is more manifestly important here.
%
%I think the better strategy is going to be to use the language of the models (rather than observables) as the comparison point.  This will be much less political, and it can turn into a limit from each experiment on the cut-off scale as a function of mass for the EFT, or masses and couplings in a given simplified model.  The complementarity of experiments will be manifest there, but no one will need to feel territorial about their own turf.
%
%I also object to framing the discussion of the EFT as a discussion of “validity”.  The EFT is valid only as a proxy for a given model, and to ask the question as just the EFT being valid or invalid at the LHC is a question without any meaningful well-defined answer.  To ask how well it does requires one to know the model that describes higher energies, and this is a case where we don’t have that information — which is the point!  I appreciate that what you are advocating to do in practice is the correct thing (and what I have also advocated for all along), but to frame it as a question of validity of the LHC results on EFTs is very misleading and contributes ammunition to those people such as the one I mentioned before who are very confident shouting about things they do not understand.
 
%Since this method uses the physical couplings and energy scale $\Qtr$, it gives the strongest possible constraints in the EFT limit while remaining robust by ensuring the validity of the EFT approximation.
%TODO: Too strong of a statement? CD: more like - this does not parse. Removed.

If a search is not simply a counting experiment and exploits the shapes of kinematic distributions, the condition on the momentum transfer should be applied on the benchmarks using generator level information, by discarding events that are invalid. This provides the necessary rescaling of the cross section while keeping the information on the change in the kinematic distributions due to the removal of the invalid events.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Outline of the procedure described in Ref.~\cite{Racco:2015dxa}}{Outline of the procedure described in Refs.}}
\label{sec:TruncationWithSHat}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In \cite{Racco:2015dxa} a procedure to extract model independent and consistent bounds within the EFT is described. This procedure can be applied to any effective Lagrangian describing the interactions between the DM and the SM, and provides limits that can be directly reinterpreted in any completion of the EFT.

The range of applicability of the EFT is defined by a mass scale \Mcut, a parameter which marks the upper limit of the range of energy scales at which the EFT can be used reliably, independently of the particular completion of the model. 
Regardless of the  details of the full theory, the energy scale for which the EFT is a good approximation is less than the center-of-mass energy $E_\text{cm}$, the total invariant mass of the hard final states of the reaction.%removed "or equal to"

%To be specific, consider the basic mono-jet process with kinematics
%$p_1 + p_2 \to k + p_{\bar\chiDM\chiDM}$: $k$ is the momentum of the outgoing jet, whereas $p_{\bar\chiDM\chiDM}$ is the momentum of the $\bar\chiDM\chiDM$ pair and
%$p_{\bar\chiDM\chiDM}=\Qtr$.  $E_\text{cm}^2 = (p_1+p_2)^2 > \Qtr^2$.

The condition ensuring that the EFT approximation is appropriate is, by definition of \Mcut,

\begin{equation}
\label{Ecm<Mcut}
E_\text{cm}<M_\text{cut}\,.
\end{equation}

For example, in the specific case of a tree level mediation with a single mediator, \Mcut can be interpreted as the mass of that mediator.

There are then at least three free parameters describing an EFT:~ 
the DM mass $m_\text{DM}$, the scale $\Mstar$ of the interaction, and the cutoff scale \Mcut.

We can use the same technique as above to restrict the signal to the events for which $E_\text{cm}<M_\text{cut}$,  using only these events to derive the exclusion limits on $\Mstar$ as a function of  $(m_\text{DM},M_{\rm cut})$. 
%
We can also define an \textit{effective coupling strength} $\Mcut=\gstar \, \Mstar\,,$ where \gstar is a free parameter that substitutes the parameter \Mcut, and therefore derive exclusions on \Mstar as a function of $(\mDM,\gstar)$. This allows us to see how much of the theoretically allowed parameter space has been actually tested and how much is still unexplored; For example, in the \Zprime-type model considered above, \gstar is equal to $\sqrt{\gDM\gq}$.
%
The resulting plots are shown in \cite{Racco:2015dxa} for a particular effective operator. 

The advantage of this procedure is that the obtained bounds can be directly and easily recast in any  completion of the EFT, by computing the parameters \Mstar, \Mcut in the full model as functions of the parameters of the complete theory. On the other hand, the resulting limits will be weaker than those obtained using \Qtr and a specific UV completion.

\section{Presentation of EFT results} %change this title
\label{sec:RecommendationEFTResults}

A full discussion of the presentation of collider results is left to 
work beyond this Forum, where ATLAS, CMS, the theory community
and the Direct and Indirect Detection communities are involved. 
In this report we recommend two strategies for the presentation of results
in terms of Effective Field Theories. We divide the EFT operators in two categories: 
those which can be mapped to one or more UV-complete simplified models, such as those
commonly used in LHC searches so far and detailed in~\cite{Goodman:2010ku}, and those
for which no UV completion is available, such as those outlined in Section~\ref{sec:EFT_models_with_direct_DM_boson_couplings}. The For the first case, the EFT is supposed to cover the cases where the mediating particles are heavy,
thus overlapping with the simplified models outlined in this report.
Results for this first class of operators can be recast starting from simplified models with high mediator masses, 
therefore removing the need to explicitly simulate EFT events but still effectively providing experimental limits
for those operators. For the second class of models, a truncation procedure 
should be applied for various hypotheses on the goodness of the EFT approximation, 
and the truncated results presented alongside the full EFT results.

Three proposals for the treatment of EFT have been stated so far,
to complement raw EFT results: (1) truncate using \Qtr, (2) truncate and iterate using \Qtr, and
(3) truncate using \Ecm.  The reliability of the EFT approximation can
also be quantified by presenting the sensitivity of the results to \Reft, the fraction of events
that satisfy $\hat{s} > \Mcut ^2$, for example.

\section{Recommendation for contact interaction theories with simplified models available}

\caption{Comparison of the 95\% CL lower limits on the scale of the interaction of a \Zprime-like simplified model at 14~\tev, in terms of the mediator mass.

\label{fig:monojet_MstarMmed}
\end{figure}

If a simplified model can be mapped to a given EFT, then the model's high-mediator-mass limit 
will converge to the EFT. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:monojet_MstarMmed}, where the limits on 
the scale of the interaction of a \Zprime-like simplified model are presented in terms of the mediator mass~\footnote{This plot only serves as exemplification of the convergence of the simplified model to a contact
	interaction operator: before this report, ATLAS and CMS searches presented search results up to very high couplings and therefore high widths, potentially probing unphysical corners of phase space}. 
The limits at high mediator mass for this model are equivalent to those of the corresponding EFT benchmark. 
For this reason, experimental collaboration should deliver results for high-mass mediators instead of 
pure EFT results, and leave further reinterpretation to theorists.
\Todo{The extrapolation to other couplings and mediator masses can be
done using the \Qtr prescription for that model. CD: I think this was Steve M - what do you mean?}

We therefore recommend the addition of one point at very high mediator mass (5 \tev) to the scan, for each of the DM masses for the simplified models described in Section~\ref{subsec:MonojetLikeModels}. The truncation procedure in Section~\ref{sec:TruncationWithSHat} can be used to fine-tune the mediator mass to be simulated for this purpose.

\section{Recommendation for truncation of EFT benchmarks with no simplified models available}

Whenever a UV completion is not available, EFT results can still
be a source of useful information as 
described in Section~\ref{sub:validityEWContact}. 
However, we can only naively control how well the EFT approximation holds.
Despite the fact that a propagator was introduced to motivate
the truncation procedure for \schannel models, the prescription
depends upon the simplified model to derive the
energy scaling that is used for the comparison with the momentum transfer. 
The simple fact remains that the effective
coupling of the operator -- $g/\Lambda^n$ -- should not allow
momentum flow $Q>\Lambda$ or $g>4\pi$.  Given our ignorance of
the actual kinematics, 
the truncation procedure suggested for this purpose
is the one described in Section~\ref{sec:TruncationWithSHat},
as it is independent from any UV completion details. 

Because there is no UV completion,
the parameter \Mcut can be treated more freely than
an explicit function of $g$ and $\Lambda$.
It makes sense to choose \Mcut such that we 
identify the transition region where the EFT stops being
a good description of UV complete 
theories. This can be done using the ratio \Reft, which is defined
as the fraction of events for which $s_{hat} > \Mcut^2$. 
For large values of \Mcut, no events are thrown away in the truncation 
procedure, and R=1. As \Mcut becomes smaller, eventually all events are thrown 
away in the truncation procedure, i.e. $\Reft=0$, and the EFT gives no 
exclusion limits for the chosen acceptance.  

We propose a rough scan over \Mcut, such that we find the values of \Mcut 
for which \Reft ranges from 0.1 to 1. The analysis can then perform a scan over 
several values of \Mcut, and show the truncated limit 
for each one of them alongside the naive limit corresponding to $\Reft=1$. 

%When \Reft=0, there is no limit. When \Reft reaches 1, the truncated limit 
%is identical to the original limit. (<== These last two sentences may be overkill. 
%Cut it if you think this is already clear)
